00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,060
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,200
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,600
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,300
If something happens to me...

5
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,030
...Shahzade's daughter Halime,
her brother who is our prisoner...

6
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,100
...and your Alp Turgut...

7
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,130
...may turn up dead.

8
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,100
I already took my precautions, Ertugrul.

9
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,830
I have so many men in this palace
who will take the life of Halime...

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,030
...where Titus' arrow had failed.

11
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,900
I am not even counting
the ones in Kayi.

12
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,500
What happened, Ertugrul?
Did you abandon the idea of killing me?

13
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,030
Go on, kill me.

14
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,330
Why did you stop? Kill me, Ertugrul!

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,060
I will expose the people
who made you do this one by one.

16
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,460
Then...

17
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,530
...may God be my witness that I shall
kill you with my own hands, Nasir.

18
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,430
Guards!

19
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,100
Guards!

20
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Catch him!

21
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Don't let him escape! Bring him to me!

22
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,230
I saw him, he is running away.
He went that way! Catch him!

23
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,000
Please...

24
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,060
...do not get up.

25
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
How is the sunlight of my palace?

26
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,300
I am better, thank you.

27
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,860
This is great.

28
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,900
I talked with the physician as well.
He says that you are better.

29
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,260
May God bless him.
He went into a lot of trouble to cure me.

30
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,060
Governess Ummulhayr was always by my side.

31
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,200
All thanks to you.

32
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,330
I was waiting impatiently
for you to get well.

33
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,260
I was waiting so that instead of talking
about health in this gloomy room...

34
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,800
...we can walk in the gardens of Aleppo.

35
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,230
And talk about nice topics.
Poetry for example.

36
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Do you like poetry, Halime?

37
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,230
I would have liked to read you
some of the poems I wrote.

38
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,360
As I am recovered now,
I will need to leave the palace soon.

39
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,900
I would like to be with my loved ones
as soon as possible.

40
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,300
Moreover, I have been a burden on
Leila Sultan for some time.

41
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,960
Governess? Where is Leila?

42
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,960
You are safe here.

43
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,330
No one knows this hideout.

44
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,860
Who are you?

45
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,860
I am the niece of the man who you saved.

46
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,860
Vizier Sahabettin's.

47
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,060
So you are El Aziz's sister.

48
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I saw how you risked your own life
to save my uncle from...

49
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,560
...the foolish decree of my brother.
I am not your enemy.

50
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,000
It is unclear who is
a friend or foe in Aleppo.

51
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,900
Only my uncle can save our city from
this state. That is why I am helping you.

52
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,960
My uncle's friend is my friend as well.

53
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,200
What if you are also a foe
who looks like a friend?

54
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,900
Spend the night here. I will get you
out of here when the palace calms down.

55
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,200
I don't think I have another choice.

56
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,100
All the exits are blocked, sir.
We will find him sooner or later.

57
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,500
Look in all holes, all cracks, understood?

58
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,560
No one shall know
that Ertugrul has escaped.

59
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,030
Especially his highness,
the Ameer El Aziz.

60
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,360
Get out!

61
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,130
I still see Ertugrul being taken
when I close my eyes, Aykiz.

62
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,300
We have to find a way and reach them.

63
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,960
My Turgut...

64
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,560
...if he is still alive...

65
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,530
...only Ertugrul can save him.

66
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,860
Dogan?

67
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,460
Shall we pray, Yigit?

68
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,900
I am going to ask you something.

69
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,530
That man Turgut...

70
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,130
...do you think he speaks the truth
about my father's death?

71
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,160
He never lies.

72
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,960
Alright.

73
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,230
Now repeat everything I do.

74
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,260
When you are going to pray,
go to your room and close the door.

75
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,460
Pray to our Father secretly.

76
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,800
Everything that is done secretly
shall be rewarded by our Father.

77
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,200
Do not pray with empty words,
like the infidels.

78
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,130
They only try to be heard with verbiage.

79
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,930
Do not be one of them.

80
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,100
Because our Father would know what we need
even before we say and bless it to us.

81
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
Pray like this:

82
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,430
Our Holy Father up in the sky.
Thou name shall always be sacred.

83
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,330
Amen.

84
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,130
Welcome.

85
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Why do you say welcome
as if we have good news to give them.

86
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,900
Do not be agonized.
We know about the things that happened.

87
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,300
So you know.

88
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,330
We wouldn't have liked to
greet you with our heads down...

89
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,530
...but we faced many troubles.

90
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,860
-Turgut Alp is our flesh and blood.
-I said I know what happened.

91
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,260
We should talk about
what we need to do now.

92
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,060
Aleppo has gone out of control.

93
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,500
Vizier Sahabettin.

94
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,900
He is a fugitive.

95
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,400
We brought him here,
as the lodge was the most secure place.

96
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,360
He needs to return to his post
for all the problems to be solved.

97
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,200
How does this concern Turgut?

98
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,300
As I said, Baci.
Here, everything is a tangled mess.

99
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,300
But Ertugrul Bey has a idea
to put everything into order.

100
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,800
And for this idea, he sacrificed himself.

101
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,860
You must be hungry.

102
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,430
You have to regain your strength.

103
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,360
Thank you.

104
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,030
Please do not endanger yourself
for me anymore.

105
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,230
I want my uncle to return to the palace
where he belongs, as soon as possible.

106
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,530
That is all.

107
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
The guards are still running about.

108
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,200
Try to manage with this until the morning.
I will find a way to get you out of here.

109
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,460
My problem is not getting out of
the palace, it is Nasir.

110
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,460
He is the one who sold out
your uncle and us.

111
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,030
Do you understand?

112
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,860
In this cold weather, drink so that you
can warm up a bit, my son.

113
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,560
Thank you.

114
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,330
With this holy duty, you deserve a place
in the heaven kingdom of our Father.

115
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,900
You come and drink some as well, my son.

116
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,900
We have to show this sinner soul
that has collaborated with the devil...

117
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,300
...the path of our Messiah, Jesus Christ.

118
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,800
-Here you are, son.
-Thank you.

119
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,330
Share with the others,
they should warm up a bit as well.

120
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,100
May God protect you.

121
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,200
My brave, how are you?

122
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Drink, drink up.

123
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,260
I will get you out of here as soon as
possible, try to bear it, alright?

124
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,000
Recite the patience invocation,
I promise that I will get you out of here.

125
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,130
Don't. I won't leave Yigit to them.

126
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,260
Yigit and you will go out of
this castle safe and sound, trust me.

127
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,360
With God's permission, in this castle...

128
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,160
...I will be a martyr.

129
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,460
If the road takes you...

130
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,830
...to my tribe...

131
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,560
...to Kayis...

132
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,600
...one day...

133
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,430
...find Aykiz...

134
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,860
...tell her that...

135
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,830
...Turgut...

136
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,160
...for even one second...

137
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,200
...did not forget you.

138
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,460
That I bore all the pain...

139
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,330
...by thinking her love at all times.

140
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,130
Find Aykiz...

141
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,560
...and...

142
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,260
...tell her that I love her very much.

143
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,860
Alright, Alfin Bey?

144
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,430
You will tell all these to Aykiz yourself.
I promise you, I will get you out of here.

145
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,560
Drink some more.

146
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,960
Recite patience.

147
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,560
Patience.

148
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,830
Dear God...

149
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,530
Dear God...

150
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,160
May God protect you, my sons.

151
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,600
Ertugrul did what he always does again.

152
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,100
Is it a lie?

153
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,400
Ertugrul Bey messes everything up...

154
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,860
...and you end up worrying for him.

155
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,960
What should I have done, Hatun?

156
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,200
Should I have said, nothing that happens
in the tribe concerns me?

157
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,930
All I am saying is that you are being
the Bey of the tribe at the moment and...

158
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,130
...that your father should know this.

159
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,160
Will you abide them turning a blind eye
to whatever he does once again?

160
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,830
Ertugrul should pay the price of
the damage he caused for these people.

161
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,400
The great Kayi tribe. We don't have
a home, we don't have land...

162
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,560
...we don't have plentiful food...

163
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,400
...instead of thinking about these,
you still think of evil, Hatun.

164
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
Is it a lie?

165
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,330
As if these were not enough...

166
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,530
...you stick your nose into things
that don't concern you even when pregnant.

167
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,900
What more can I say to you, Hatun?

168
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,330
What can I say?

169
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,130
The letter you have written to
the Pope and Emperor Frederic...

170
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,460
...is not an ordinary letter anymore,
Thomas.

171
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,000
I was just thinking what you might give...

172
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,000
...to see what I have written,
my dear friend Petruccio.

173
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,360
You have learned our power.
Out network of spies...

174
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,300
...our financial sources...

175
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,560
...and the opportunities
we can present for a new crusade.

176
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,400
Especially for you, my dear friend.

177
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,600
What if you fail at the crusade?

178
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,830
Would that be important after you became
the Pope, my dear friend Thomas?

179
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,260
Yigit, listen to me very well.
You have to be very careful, alright?

180
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,000
Did you understand what I said?

181
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,030
You have to get that key from Marcus
at all costs.

182
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,560
We will overcome and
solve everything, alright?

183
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,200
You are a strong man.

184
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,500
That is obvious.

185
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,300
But you came out stronger than we thought.

186
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,530
You did not collapse
after everything you went through.

187
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,400
Well done.

188
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,230
You are like a raging bull.

189
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,960
Like a bull challenging his toreador.

190
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,800
You are not very talkative...

191
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,830
...but I can find a topic
that might interest you.

192
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,060
Aykiz.

193
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,830
The name you blabber while being tortured.

194
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,500
Is she your lover?

195
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,100
I don't think you will talk to me.

196
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,330
Shame.

197
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,460
Then I am going.

198
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,000
What do you want from me?

199
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,800
Your father's killer?

200
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,460
My father.

201
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,460
In this state?

202
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,130
I cannot go into the dungeon...

203
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,000
...but I know that there is a prisoner
in there called Giovanni.

204
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,600
There is only...

205
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,600
...a Muslim man called Omer in there.

206
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,830
I want you to ask something to that man.

207
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,500
Whether she knows a girl called Isadora.

208
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,460
If you can give me a reply...

209
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,900
...I would do anything I can
for you to escape from here.

210
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,360
How will I give you the answer?

211
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,800
Shahzade Yigit will help us.

212
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,930
Vizier is trapped. Turgut is far away.

213
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,500
Ertugrul Bey is away in the dungeons.

214
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,930
Aykutluk became a martyr.

215
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,600
We are left all alone here.

216
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,500
-Where are they?
-They are here, sir.

217
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,300
Ertugrul?

218
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,400
I am waiting outside.

219
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,300
Vizier...

220
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,300
...I know how much
you tried to help Kayis...

221
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,200
...thanks to Dogan and Bamsi.

222
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,430
They also told us
the conspiracy against you.

223
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,060
If you find it suitable as well...

224
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,500
...you should be taken somewhere
where no one can reach you.

225
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,600
Let us take you to Kayi tribe.

226
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:54,060
Not only the Templars, even if
the 70 kings of the Roman cities...

227
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,500
...unite to attack us,
they cannot take you out from there.

228
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,930
Suleyman Shah, your offer
made me more than happy but...

229
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,130
...I am afraid to bring more disasters
to your already distressed tribe.

230
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,460
Let disaster come to a brave,
while he is being brave...

231
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,530
...it would be an honor.

232
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,030
Rahman...

233
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,060
...Ilyas Fakih...

234
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,600
...take our vizier to the tribe
without attracting attention.

235
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,300
Just like written
in the letter to the Jews...

236
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,830
...in a way to please God...

237
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,230
...with fear and respect...

238
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,500
...let us pray.

239
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,560
My holy brother, if you accept as well...

240
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:05,300
...participating in a sermon by a monk
like you, who has devoted his life...

241
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,230
...to the Messiah, would be
a great honor to all Templar knights.

242
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,600
By sitting in the shelter of the Creator,
the One who has the power...

243
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,300
...to do anything,
he takes refuge in His shadow.

244
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,230
He is my shelter, my fortress!
I say for God.

245
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,460
He is my God, I trust Him.

246
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,860
Because He protects you from the traps
of the hunters and all deadly diseases!

247
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,930
He takes you under His wings.
You take shelter under them.

248
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,260
His loyalty becomes
your shield and shelter.

249
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,300
Amen.

250
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,800
Do not forget...

251
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,960
...some non believers who reject
the Messiah Jesus Christ...

252
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,960
...have secretly infiltrated amongst us.

253
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,560
It has been written long ago that
they shall be tried!

254
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,600
Amen!

255
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,830
Nasir...

256
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,530
...hasn't Esma been found yet?

257
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,960
Your highness, most probably the Templars
who are collaborating with Sahabetttin...

258
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,900
...have kidnapped her as well.

259
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,030
Come with me, let us interrogate Ertugrul.

260
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,060
When I think that my brother is in their
hands, I am about to lose my mind, father.

261
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,160
Ertugrul?

262
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,460
Halime?

263
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,960
Leila, my girl,
what do you think you are doing?

264
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,860
How can you help this man?
How can you bring him to this room?

265
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,000
I had to.
They are looking for him everywhere.

266
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,460
This is the only place
where I can hide him.

267
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,360
That is what I was saying.
They are looking for this man everywhere.

268
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,160
And you brought him to your own room.

269
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,930
Did you ever think what would happen to us
if your brother finds out that he is here?

270
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,600
If my brother finds out that he is here,
I would commit suicide.

271
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,330
-Do you understand me?
-God, Great God.

272
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,030
I am Kayi tribe's Bey Suleyman Shah.
I came to talk to you.

273
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,900
As you took the trouble to come all
the way here, I am listening, Turkmens.

274
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,400
Free my son whom
you have imprisoned unjustly.

275
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,430
And rehabilitate the dignity of the Kayis
whom you slandered with plague claims.

276
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,400
What would happen
if we don't do what you say?

277
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,400
We would still settle
in the lands you had promised us before.

278
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,360
But if my son Ertugrul is not freed...

279
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,100
...while a tribe is being settled there,
a city would be burnt down here.

280
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,160
Aleppo would be wasted!

281
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:38,960
Alright, Suleyman Shah but what would
you do if I raise my army and come to you?

282
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,030
Whom do you trust to talk like this?

283
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,360
When you put us in the edge of
the Crusader countship...

284
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,030
...we said yes putting our trust in Him
and we trust Him again!

285
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,830
Do now forget, your highness Ameer...

286
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,330
...us Kayis believe in God,
we trust Him and take refuge in Him.

287
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,900
If your army is greater than Him, come.

288
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
We shall be waiting in our tribe.

289
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,000
Nasir...

290
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,800
...if Sahabettin is with them,
our job is very difficult.

291
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,100
Your highness, give me permission
to put them in their places.

292
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,600
I want to be informed about
every step Kayis take.

293
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,600
Alright?

294
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,160
I have a feeling that
we can find my uncle if we follow them.

295
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,860
The rear side of our Bey's marquee
shall always be protected strongly.

296
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,030
The tents of the Alps shall be
distributed in the outer rings.

297
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,360
We can make this flat area ahead
our training ground.

298
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,560
The people have started to put up
their tents. Shall we wait for our Bey?

299
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,960
We didn't come here
to scratch the soil, Alpargu.

300
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,300
We will of course set up our tents.

301
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,260
Make sure that your Alps are ready
at all times.

302
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,960
An infidel might come out
from behind those mountains...

303
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,000
...or an attack from our so called
religion brothers may come any minute.

304
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,960
That is why you should be alert
at all times.

305
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,030
Hatun...

306
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,300
...you are carrying two lives...

307
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,400
...put it down. We can carry them.

308
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,600
There is still a long time, Gundogdu.

309
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,400
I cannot sit around empty handed
while there is so much work to do.

310
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,860
-Peace be upon you, Gundogdu Bey.
-And peace be upon you.

311
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,400
God bless you all,
you have settled so quickly.

312
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,930
Thanks to God, Fakih. Thanks to God.

313
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,030
Aleppo vizier, Sahabettin Tugrul.

314
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,830
Welcome, we are happy to see you.

315
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,560
My brother Ertugrul
always spoke highly of you.

316
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,860
Thank you, I am grateful.

317
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,530
May your new homeland be a blessing.

318
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,030
Thank you.

319
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,430
Bey...

320
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,000
...and about the identity of
the woman at the back...

321
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,960
...we should ask the devil.

322
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,560
Please.

323
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,200
Shahzade, I will save Turgut from
the dungeon in the first chance I get.

324
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,530
You stay in the courtyard or the corridor
in order not to attract attention, okay?

325
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,160
We will have only one chance.

326
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,560
God willing, you should not need
to use this but you should...

327
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,560
...have it.

328
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,830
