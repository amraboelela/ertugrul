For the men who died...
Our brothers ask for your
blessing one last time.
Do you bless them?
We bless them!
Do you bless them?
We bless them!
Do you bless them?
We bless them!
If God permits,
they will forgive us as well.
For our Great Prophet
Mohammed’s assistance...
For the souls of our brothers...
For the unity and blessing of our tribe...
For God’s mercy...
...recite Al Fatiha prayer.
My Beys...
My braves...
Wise men of my tribe...
...I know what is in your hearts...
...we have the right for revenge
from this lowlife.
He should not get away with the blood he
spilt and the curses he got for cruelty.
But...
...executing this lowlife is not for us.
His sentence should be given
by Sultan Aladdin.
Suleyman Shah...
...how many mothers are mourning now.
They think about their loved ones
who died at the hands of Karatoygar.
Your words are burning through our hearts.
You are so unaware! When did you see
our Bey make our tribe bow down in shame?
Our Bey knows what is best for all of us.
My Beys...
...we have the right to blood,
that is a fact but...
...practicing eye for an eye
is not an honor for us.
The sentence for collaborating with
the Crusaders and betraying the state...
...should be given by Sultan Aladdin.
Does anyone have an objection?
Commander Sari Bolu shall take Karatoygar
to Konya and deliver him to the palace.
The lowlife dog will understand
before his last breath that...
...treachery would be punished
sooner or later.
Commander, you are a lucky man.
You will see this black pig drowning
in his own blood.
We have to set on the road
to Aleppo in two days.
Are the preparations completed?
We have packed everything, Bey. Only
the dismantling of the carpet workshop...
...and the tents are left.
The herds have already
started the journey, Bey.
I sent some trusted Alps
with the herders as well.
Then the job of taking the agreement to
El Aziz and building the stables...
...and sheep pens shall be...
...yours, Gundogdu.
Father, with your permission...
Father?
Suleyman!
Suleyman!
Bey?
Father?
Now it is up to you.
You will go to Sultan Aladdin
and tell him everything.
You will tell him that Kayis...
...kidnapped the traitor Shahzades
you were taking to Konya...
...then used their names to get support
from other Turkmen tribes for an uprising.
They want to rise up
and overthrow Sultan Aladdin.
I could not acknowledge such a thing,
so I set off on the road again...
...to take the rebellious
Shahzades to Konya.
They ambushed me. Killed all my soldiers.
My most trusted commander, Sari Bolu.
They cut his throat, right in front of me.
You will take an army from
Sultan Aladdin and bring them here.
Kayis will understand
why they call you the Fire of Wrath.
Then you will return back to
Konya and become the right hand man...
...of the sultan you have just saved.
I did what I could do.
Unfortunately his fever is not going down.
They only thing we can do now is pray.
Our Bey...
...would like us to do our chores
and jobs whatever happens.
We all know our jobs and chores.
When he opens his eyes...
...he should see that all is done.
We have a long road
ahead of us to Aleppo...
...but none of us shall give up.
ALEPPO
Welcome back, my Sheikh.
Thank you, grandson of my master.
May God have his mercy over us.
Your heavenly grandfather had said...
...“every bird flies with their own kind.
Eagles with eagles. Crows with crows.”
Aleppo has become very crowded.
Eagles are at one gate
and crows on the other.
They all have different problems.
Some are after their food, not caring
about whether it is lawful or not...
...others are after a post. They don't
care whether God has given consent or not.
If they have traps or bad intensions...
...God has a reckoning as well.
But God is the most dutiful Trap Setter.
Dear God. Of course.
Good news for you, Selcan Hatun.
Your intuition was right.
From now on you will not only live for
your husband, but for your son as well.
A long journey awaits Ertugrul and us.
We are impatient to leave...
...but this will be the hardest
journey I will be on.
I know.
Be my confidant, my comrade, Sultan.
If only things were different.
If only.
I heard that...
...Suleyman Shah is not well.
They say Azrael is walking around him.
They say he waits for
his time in his deathbed.
We piled more problems over his troubles.
We became a big burden for him.
May God help him.
Amen.
Suleyman Shah said that...
...Gundogdu Bey will be going to Aleppo.
She will take you there, Halime.
Gundogdu Bey?
Do not forget to dismantle this.
Tie them well.
We have a long road ahead of us.
So you came, Kurdoglu.
When you hear the things I am going
to say, you will be surprised.
The identities of our valuable guests
who brought...
...nothing but dark clouds over our tribe
are revealed.
Numan who claimed to be a trader
was actually a Seljuk Shahzade.
But what is your intention
in telling me this news, Selcan Hatun?
I saw what you can do with
a small bit of information, Kurdoglu.
My father and Uncle Kurdoglu
went on a hunt one day.
They were both around our ages then.
Uncle Kurdoglu fell of his horse.
Why? Did something happen to the horse?
The horse had startled because
there was a big bear in front of them.
What did Kurdoglu do?
My uncle could not do anything
because his leg was broken.
When that bear was about to
tear my uncle apart...
...my father came and
killed the bear with his spear.
You father is very brave.
They became blood brothers then.
Yigit, you will be going tomorrow.
When you go, please don’t forget that
you have a brother in Kayi tribe.
Let us go.
Yigit...
...look.
Run.
Dear God, Who has given secrets
to us herbalists...
...spare us from troubles without remedy.
They are upstairs.
Welcome, Nasir.
You called for me, sir.
Go to El Aziz immediately and tell him to
stop Kayis from settling at our borders.
But, sir, Titus...
I cannot waste time by talking about...
...the stupid decisions Titus made.
He is only a pawn
who thinks he is a vizier.
It is very hard to dissuade
El Aziz from his decision.
He really liked the Kayis.
Is his love for Kayis so big that
he is prepared to let black death...
...roam over Aleppo?
Did you manage to find the person
who sent the spies to kill Ertugrul?
According to the information I have, the
Templars have mobilized all their spies.
I am trying to uncover
their sources within the palace.
Come, Nasir, come. Come.
Sir, the problem is important,
I did not want to wait for the morning.
Intelligence have been informing
about the plague in Anatolia.
I wanted to be sure whether our potential
allies have been plagued or not.
Sir, I know, you liked Kayis very much.
I also believe that they are
most suitable for holding our borders...
...if a new Crusader campaign starts.
But...
But what, Nasir?
Sir, unfortunately
most of their livestock have perished.
Don’t...
...reject them from our borders, Nasir.
Do you understand? Don’t.
When he brings the agreement,
I personally want to talk with Ertugrul.
Come on now, Gundogdu.
All the Beys have gathered in the tent.
Today is the day.
Do not talk like
my father has died, Kurdoglu.
You are the tribe’s son as much as
you are your father’s son, Gundogdu.
Will you sit in your tent like
a woman while your tribe is in trouble?
As we move down to the plains from
the highlands the troubles shall cease...
...and my father will get well.
I have nothing else to say, Kurdoglu.
Do you know what you will face while going
down to the plains from the highlands?
What are you trying to say, Emmi?
I am saying that...
...this path we are taking
is not wise, son.
This is the headquarter’s decision
and my father’s order.
This is my final word, Kurdoglu.
Do you think that I want to be
the acting Bey...
...and to sit in the marquee
under your father’s shadow?
Don’t you know me, Gundogdu?
Wasn’t it you who said your father is
too old to perform his Bey duties...
...and asked me support you
to become the new Bey?
Didn’t I tell you that I would be
supporting you until the end?
What is your cause now?
I am an old man with only
a few years to live.
I told you numerous times that the tribe
needs a brave, determined Bey like you.
I would like you to trust me
until I save you from these problems...
...and make you a Bey in our new home.
Come to the point, Emmi.
I have learned the real identity
the ominous guests Ertugrul brought here.
I know that Numan and his son are from
the Seljuk dynasty, they are Shahzades.
Those people who you call faceless
are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.
The man called Numan is a Shahzade and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.
If we deliver them...
...the Sultan would award our tribe.
We can settle in the best places of
Seljuk territory.
What do you want from me, Kurdoglu?
Give up on Aleppo.
Aleppo will be our doom.
We should take them tonight...
...and deliver them
to the Sultan, Gundogdu.
May God spare you for us and Kayis.
Bey...
...we are ready for the ambush.
At least say, peace be upon you.
Alpargu, you go out.
I was expecting you.
But I was not expecting you, Gundogdu.
Kurdoglu will go at night
to ambush a tent and kidnap a Shahzade...
...and I will miss this party.
How can this be?
Have you become a guard to the tent of
the people whom you were crying out...
...for them to leave yesterday?
In a tribe where you try to collect
support to become a Bey...
...let us become a guard.
Emmi...
...this tribe should have a guard.
So that bandits and dogs don’t roam
about inside the camp.
Now tell me, where did you learn
this Shahzade issue?
When I went to Karatoygar
as a messenger, I inquired around.
I connected the dots.
Why did you keep it a secret until now?
The same reason as why Suleyman Shah
kept it a secret from his own son.
You lie.
You asked, I answered.
Whoever sowed the seeds of suspicion
inside you, go and ask them!
Those people who you call faceless
are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.
The man called Numan is a Shahzade and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.
Brother, I need to talk with you.
Not now.
Brother!
I said, not now, Dundar!
Gundogdu...
...did something bad happen?
Was it you who told Kurdoglu that
Numan and his son were Shahzades, Hatun?
What happened?
Answer me. Did you tell him or not?
What Shahzade, Gundogdu?
What are you talking about?
What made you so angry?
Kurdoglu learned that
they are Shahzades, Hatun.
What did he do then?
I don’t know his intention
but he wanted to imprison them.
Where are the Shahzades?
They left with Ertugrul.
I want you to take the agreement
to El Aziz, Ertugrul.
But brother,
my father gave this duty to you.
Very well, and I am giving it to you.
We should both do the jobs we know best,
Ertugrul. Don’t you always say...
...let the headquarter be yours
and hunt mine?
And you let them go? What are you up to?
What is it to you?
Did you tell him or not?
I did not tell, Gundogdu.
What business can I have with Kurdoglu?
Did Kurdoglu tell you
that he heard it from me?
He said that it was someone else.
But if it was you, Hatun...
...may God be my witness that...
You were not like this.
Something happened to you.
Don’t you trust the woman
who is carrying your child in her womb?
To your wife who is going to
give you a son?
Bey, Ertugrul and his Alps have left.
Round up the men you trust,
they should go after them.
Tell them not to refrain from
spilling blood if needed.
