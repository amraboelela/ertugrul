00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.500
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.600
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.960
Where do you come from and
where do you go?

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.360
We come from nowhere, to go anywhere.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.830
What about you?

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.300
We are going to Aleppo.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.160
Then you should always be alert.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.830
Don’t become a hunt for
wolves and vultures.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.100
The air here is very hazy.
Don’t be lost in the haze.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.530
Will you grant me your name?

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.330
Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.400
The time has come.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.330
-Horses?
-Horses are ready.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.960
I hid the saddles under the hay.
We will saddle up and go immediately.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.360
There is no guard at the stable.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.130
-Will you be able to endure it, father?
-We have to do this.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.260
May you have a good journey.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.060
May the sun not burn you.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.800
May you don’t get cold.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.060
May your feet don’t touch a stone.
May you go like water...

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.230
...return to your tribe like water.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.130
Bamsi, is he asleep?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.600
No, he is thinking of Halime Baci.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.500
-Keep your voice down!
-Don’t talk to me like that.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.500
Enough! Be quiet!

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.500
Go to sleep. Be quiet.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.000
You should relax, Titus.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.560
Before the sunrise,
we shall both get what we want.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.200
To look down on the enemy
is for the stupid, Karatoygar.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.530
No one can escape from
a well planned ambush, Titus.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.530
No one.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.330
I will deal with Wild Demir.
You finish the job quietly.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.400
Come on.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.860
Turgut!

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.330
The boy is dead.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.330
Yigit Alp!

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.830
Let them go or I will kill you all.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.330
Do you think we are stupid?
Get out of our way.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.860
I thought I made myself clear. You either
let them go or I will kill you all.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.360
I won’t. Get out of the way or
I will kill the girl.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.600
This is my last warning! Let them go!

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.960
Yigit Alp. Yigit Alp!

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.860
Who are you?

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.130
Afsin.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.330
And I am Deli.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.260
Look at the scholar.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.600
He fights well.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.200
He may be a scholar but he is on fire!

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.500
My brother...

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.530
...how is your wound?

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.030
The tip is broken inside.
We should take it out immediately.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.960
We cannot do it here. We should leave.
Others might come as well.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.100
The arrow stops the blood.
We will cut it somewhere else.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.100
This is all Karatoygar’s doing.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.030
Let’s go.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.200
KARATOYGAR INN.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.860
You messed it all up!

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.460
First your knights...

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.500
...then my soldiers.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.330
He killed them all like mosquitoes.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:38.000
You and I made a very big mistake
by underestimating Ertugrul.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.330
From now on never...

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.230
...never try to command me.
I will settle this issue my own way.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.960
Not on my territory, Titus.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.830
If Sultan Aladdin hears about it,
our plan would be ruined.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.560
You said that you would settle this issue
and I obliged. But you messed up.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.200
You let Ertugrul escape!
I will settle it my own way!

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.000
My door is always open for you, Titus.
But...

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:18.230
...I am saying it again,
if you go on a headhunt in my territory...

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.930
...you will lose your own heads.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.930
What about in Aleppo?

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:34.230
What did you think? We have more skillful
servants than you in all the Muslim world.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.000
And know this, Karatoygar...

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.860
...if you were not Ustad-i Azam’s dog,
I would have killed you long ago.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.460
Look at the great Gundogdu.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.860
Yes, you see, Selcan Hatun...

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.260
...they tame Gundogdu like this,
so you know.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.560
You don’t get angry, you don’t build up
a rage, what is wrong with you, Gundogdu?

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.830
I am only waiting for
the right time, Hatun.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.860
Thank God. Thank you as well.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.400
May it be healthy.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.530
What is on your mind?
Will you refrain from tell me as well?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.930
Hatun, I was wronged when I was right.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.030
Look, I also got punished for it as well.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.430
I cannot digest this, Hatun.
When the time comes...

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.060
...the whole tribe will see
who Gundogdu is.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.330
Don’t let your fury cloud
your judgment, please.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.600
Selcan, winter is around the corner.
It is knocking on our door.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.130
Karatoygar made his first move.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.160
Won’t they say that Kayi could not even
protect their guests?

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.830
Won’t they? If it wasn’t for the trader’s
man, the guests would have been kidnapped.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.100
-Do you know what this means?
-What does it mean, Gundogdu?

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.460
It means this tribe is not led.
It does not have a Bey, it has no one.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.100
What will happen then?

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.960
If I am keeping quiet, if I am not tearing
everything apart, there is a reason.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.430
Now I have to be patient.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.960
Now let me work.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.300
I told you to increase the security.
What did you do? Nothing.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.530
Because of your incompetence,
the men of that dog infiltrated our camp.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.060
My honor and the tribe’s honor
was violated.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.030
-I took all measures for maximum security.
-Then how could they get in?

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.430
How?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.960
They could not have done it
without help from inside, Bey.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.160
What does this mean?

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.500
Is something like this possible, Kurdoglu?

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.830
There is no one in our tribe
who would stoop so low, Bey.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.800
Your head of guard
is struggling to save himself.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.230
He is so belittled that
he can’t even hear his own words.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.390
You are not my head of guard anymore.
Gather all the guards on duty yesterday...

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.390
...and wait for my decision
on your punishment.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.330
As you wish, Bey.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.830
If Karatoygar has the nerve to raid
my tribe to kidnap our guests...

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.200
...I don’t know
what he would dare tomorrow.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.500
Bey, give me permission to go
and talk with him once again.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.930
What did you achieve last time?
He made a fool of you.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.530
You still ask to go and talk with him.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.230
He learned his lesson, Bey.
All the men he sent was killed.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.330
Now, I can talk in a language
he can understand.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.130
I know the language he would understand.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.130
Load the bodies to horses
and send back to him.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.200
From now on, we will talk the way
he would understand.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.930
Bey, what can we do against
the great Seljuk army?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.800
Don’t talk like the army is here,
Kurdoglu. It would take days for...

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.160
...Karatoygar to mobilize the army
in Erzincan and bring it here.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:15.000
Anyhow, if Karatoygar didn’t have a hidden
agenda, he would have acted long ago.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.160
He is violating the agreement I did
with the Sultan and acting on his own.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.960
Actually, as a commander he has enough
experience to know that I would crush...

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.560
...his few hundred soldiers.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.230
Then what?

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.400
The rest is up to Ertugrul’s success.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.300
One way or another,
whatever our customs say shall prevail.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.360
What will happen now, Akcakoca?

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.030
This will take away the pus of the wound.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.100
It will enable him to recover quickly.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.530
-Take this.
-If God permits. How is he?

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.000
This was not welcome before
he recovered fully but...

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.330
...there is no need to be afraid.
Do not worry.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.530
The healing process will be delayed
for a few days, that’s all.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.160
When you feel better, you should get up,
walk around a bit outside...

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.160
...it would do you good, alright?

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.800
Do not neglect to smear this ointment
on the wound three times a day.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.260
-Thank you very much, Akcakoca.
-Alright, may God be on your side.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.000
Thank you, Akcakoca.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.160
Please do not try to get up.
I just came to wish you a speedy recovery.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.400
Take these and feed your father well
so that he can get well quickly.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.530
-I owe you not one, but three lives.
-There is no debt.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.000
If you could grant me your name,
I would know the man I am thankful to.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.960
Come close, young boy.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.400
-What is this?
-This necklace belongs to your family.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.900
To the Seljuk dynasty.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.600
-Dogan, Bamsi, help him down.
-At once, Bey.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.060
Come on, let us go.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.900
My arm.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.960
My arm is bleeding.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.230
Dogan, Bamsi, fetch some wood.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.960
Drink this.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.900
He lost a lot of blood.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.330
-Come on, brother, raise your head.
-Raise your head.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.160
Ertugrul.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.000
-What happened, son?
-We were attacked.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.960
Didn’t I warn you to be careful and
say that the air is hazy around here.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.260
Dervish, bring the saddlebag.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.900
We need to stop the bleeding immediately.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.300
Part of the arrow is inside,
we need to take it out first.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.560
We can manage, with God’s help.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.300
Who are they?

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.900
Be strong, my friend.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.100
In the name of God. Come on.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.000
-Hopefully he will live.
-Bamsi, don’t open your foreboding mouth.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.460
Do not worry.
Fate protects a person from death.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.330
I served under your little brother
Melik Rukneddin.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.330
And my name is Semseddin Afsin Bey.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.260
Your brother died in my arms.
The necklace belonged to him.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.860
-You are Afsin Bey.
-That is correct, Shahzade.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.230
I heard your name before.
You were a good commander.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.800
-Thank you.
-But, how do I know that you are him?

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.500
That this is not a play
staged by Sultan Aladdin?

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.130
Afsin Bey,
why did you risk your life for us?

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.460
Your brother was my Shahzade.
But more importantly...

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.130
...your attitude toward Sultan Aladdin.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.360
You did not engage in a power struggle.
You stayed loyal to the state.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.200
You refrained from making moves
that would overshadow his successes.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.200
You didn’t cast a shadow over Seljuk’s
bright days with an ambition of power.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.800
That is why you deserve
the utmost respect, sir.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.560
With your permission, I would like to
help you escape from Karatoygar.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.530
How? It is obvious that someone
helped Karatoygar to get in.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.060
Otherwise, they could not have
entered the camp so easily.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.600
I don’t know who but
I know what he will do next.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.130
Halime?

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.560
Than God. My God give you inner peace.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.300
-Thank you, my girl.
-Please, sit.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.300
I should not bother you, sir.
You should rest.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.100
With your permission,
I will take Halime from you for a while.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.830
Mother Hayme is worried about you,
she would like to ask her how you are.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.500
Of course. The permission is yours.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.360
Why did Mother Hayme
want to see me, Aykiz?

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.900
I really don’t know either.
But you don’t need to be cautious, Halime.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.930
They are being punished
because of us, right?

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.900
They deserved the punishment they get.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.860
Bey’s honor is our honor as well.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.800
Come on now.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.160
AMANOS MOUNTAINS.
TEMPLARS CASTLE.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.200
The Muslims we killed
stirred up emotions as expected.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.430
The whole Muslim world is in rage.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.160
They will start attacking
the Christians soon.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.300
Europe cannot sit back then.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.300
Ustad-i Azam,
what will we do when they attack us?

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.060
We have limited number of
knights and soldiers.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.400
We will attack them as well.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.900
I forged up such an army, which no army
will be able to stand against.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.330
From Palestine to Basra,
from Baghdad to Aleppo...

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.460
...everywhere will be covered
by the stench of burnt bodies.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.360
The visitors you had been expecting
have arrived, sir.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.360
Good.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.560
Come now.
Let me show you my invincible army.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.560
Son of a Bey should be like this.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.030
Hamza.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.100
I am paying the price of
being presumptuous, uncle. That is all.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.230
-Good for you, my nephew.
-The ambush last night...

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.230
It was obvious that Karatoygar
would not back down.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.430
Did you know about
the ambush beforehand, uncle?

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:59.800
Thank God we have a Bey’s son whom,
for his father, even suspects his uncle.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.100
Moreover, he questions him while
looking into his eyes.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.030
Our Bey has the same suspicions.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.130
Our guests must be more precious
than we thought.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.430
Come to my tent in the evening,
we will talk there.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.960
We need to get rid of this problem before
trouble surrounds us from all sides.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.930
May it be easy on you, Mother Hayme.
Do we have permission?

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.000
You do, my girl, you do. Come in.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.430
Come and sit, my beautiful girls.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.060
I am sorry for what happened.
Thank God no one was killed.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.430
Thank God, Mother Hayme.
My father’s wound was uncalled for...

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.500
...while he was recovering
but thank God he was spared.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.930
But why are these devil mongers
imposing you?

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.360
My father is a trader, when he was
transporting goods in the Mediterranean...

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.800
...we fell captive to the Crusaders.
They wanted to sell us to Karatoygar.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.800
When you are dwelled in so much trouble,
don’t you have anyone to turn to?

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.930
Which tribe do you belong to?

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.300
-We are from Kinik tribe.
-So you are from Kinik tribe?

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.600
You carry the blood of the Bey
who founded the Seljuk state, is that so?

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:57.060
Well, which clan from the
Kinik tribe do you belong to?

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.260
-Do we have permission, Mother Hayme?
-Yes, you do. Come, my girl.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.430
-Did you bring the drapes?
-I did, Mother.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.260
The colors are faded.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.430
What did you lack in material?

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.500
There is not enough grass due to famine.
We had to water down the dye.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.230
We are doing all we can,
but this is the best we could do.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.060
Did you try the leaves and
roots of dyer’s woad?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.330
Our trader girl knows so much.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.230
She learned so many things
as she traveled the seas and mountains...

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.460
...but she forgets that grass
don’t grow during famine.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.130
If there was some, we would have used it.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.060
Selcan is right, my girl.
We need to find another solution.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.930
We don’t have much time left. We have
to go and sell these in the market...

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.530
...before we migrate but we don’t have
a single proper drape to sell.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.900
Selcan, do your best.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.300
You may leave.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.800
Do not meddle in things
that does not concern you.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.200
You are the dearest subjects
who will be going to God’s heaven.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.360
You will find peace
in the compassionate embrace of Jesus.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.860
You tasted death while alive...

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.860
...and now you will taste the peace of
redemption from all sins while you die.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.100
Mario!

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.400
Rachel, my dear girl, you will find
the peace you seek in God’s heaven.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.460
You know how much I trust your
intelligence and thus I gave you...

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.360
...the most difficult task.
Your task will be the Kayi Tribe.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.430
Two knights of mine will accompany you.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.260
My whole life was in unbearable pain, sir.
But my death will be...

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.230
...with the love of Jesus and honor.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.030
My innocent lambs,
may you have a clear journey.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.000
We did not understand your plan, sir.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.530
Black death, my dear knight.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.900
This small but powerful army
will spread the damnation of devil...

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.200
...all over the Muslim world.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.860
Wait, stop there.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.960
Do not worry. There is a way.

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.130
Come and sit here.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.860
Look, my girl. Years ago one old woman
in the palace did something...

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.830
...to make the colors more vibrant.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.530
The whole palace was surprised.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:44.060
Even my late grandfather who was
the Sultan at the time was intrigued.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:52.530
Everyone was against the poor woman. But
the colors on the drape were magnificent.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.030
What did she do, father, tell me.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.960
That is all. We set on the road from
Andalusia years ago and never looked back.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.330
What made you leave your home, dervish?

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.060
A dream.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:16.060
I am pursuing the divine call that made me
travel everywhere in the world for years.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.430
-Is there a clan called Andalusia?
-Didn’t you ever hear of Andalusia?

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.030
-Never, brother.
-Really?

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.100
-Am I lying to you?
-Sometimes I wonder why you carry a head.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.930
-Doesn’t it get too heavy?
-Leave me alone.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.500
What about you, son?
Why are you going to Aleppo?

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.500
I was sent to Ameer El Aziz
as an ambassador.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.500
-But we still couldn’t reach.
-You will, if God permits.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.330
While his highness the Prophet and
his highness Abu Bakr was migrating...

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.130
...they took refuge in a cave.
The heretics were after them.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.360
They found the tracks
that go inside the cave.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:09.900
The companion of our Prophet, Abu Bakr
was anxious. Our Prophet said to him:

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:13.960
“Don’t you worry, Abu Bakr,
God is with us.”

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.830
There, a small spider weaved them
the most protective armor of all time.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:27.500
So the real question is whether we made
God a companion to our road or not.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.800
If we did, all doors would open,
all roads would finish.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.930
If we did not,
our companion would be the devil.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.160
-Peace be upon you.
-The devil!

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.500
-Shut your mouth.
-And peace be upon you!

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.060
And peace be upon you

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.000
We saw the fire and came.
Do we have permission?

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.560
Please join us at our humble dinner.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.400
If Karatoygar attacked our camp so easily,
he must have a spy inside.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.030
No one in Kayi Tribe would dare
to be a spy for Karatoygar.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.830
What did you talk with Karatoygar?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.400
I asked for some time,
to convince Suleyman Shah.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.330
He attacked before the time was up.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.430
We cannot even protect the people
who take refuge in us.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.300
Old age made Suleyman Shah very weak.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.500
The unity and solidarity
of the tribe is at risk, Gundogdu.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.200
If we don’t act,
the great Kayi tribe will fall apart.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:07.160
He is my father but the future
of the tribe is more important.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.960
What do you have in mind?

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.960
I will wait for Ertugrul
to return from Aleppo.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.500
If he comes back empty handed,
I will act immediately.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.330
What about your father?

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:25.230
My father is my life and blood but
I would act accordingly to Oguz customs.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.860
Oguz customs tell so much to those
who know how to listen.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:49.230
We are on the road for days without food.
We were devastated.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.400
But I thank God that
he put you on our way.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.030
We can never know from where
the fortune would smile at us.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:06.160
True. We can never know from where
the trouble will come either.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.030
What is the matter?
Did something bad happen?

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.960
While our caravan was on the road,
the crusaders, those Templars attacked us.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.130
They seize every opportunity
and attack everywhere.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:22.200
Last time we met a regiment of crusaders.
We killed them all!

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.430
You did well.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:35.330
Those crusaders, where did they get the
courage to wander in the Muslim territory?

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.960
I heard that those heretics
are preparing for a new crusade.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:45.800
They mobilized the whole Christian world
to invade Jerusalem.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.330
I heard that they killed all the important
rulers in the Muslim states one by one...

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.500
...and left their bodies in town squares.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.830
So we will have a festival.
We will need to prepare a warm welcome.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.200
You jest, Bey. How will this be?
Muslims only draw swords at each other.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.200
-They kill each other.
-Don’t you worry.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.360
God would bear a big warrior and
unite the whole world under his flag.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:31.330
And his progeny would conquer
Constantinople, take Jerusalem...

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.800
...and serve Mecca and Medina.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.060
If God permits, we shall fight under
the flag of that warrior.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.230
If God permits.
I hope you are right, if God permits.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:55.230
I hope He sends that warrior soon
so that we can find peace, if God permits.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I would like to know these valuable God
followers who shared their food with us.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.800
I am...

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.460
...Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.900
Ertugrul from Kayi Tribe.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.300
