00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,030
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,600
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,460
Bey, dinner is ready. Come to the table.

5
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,800
Dundar, come on, come to the table, son.

6
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,400
I will come as soon as
I finish this, mother.

7
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,860
Always be like that, my boy.
Finish the job at hand first.

8
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,830
-Selcan?
-Yes, mother?

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
-Bring the molasses, my girl.
-Yes, mother.

10
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,330
Where is Gundogdu?

11
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,600
He went to check the shepherds,
he will come in a few minutes.

12
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,960
Put another plate on the table.
For Sungurtekin.

13
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,400
If he comes back one day, he should know
that his place is ready at the table.

14
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,400
Come on then. Why is Gundogdu late?

15
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,430
He will come, mother.

16
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,600
In the name of God.

17
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,500
Well, son? You returned with a big hunt.

18
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,100
Something like that, Bey.

19
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,400
What kind of luck is this, brother?
You are like a lightning pulling tree.

20
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,330
You attract all kinds of trouble
to yourself.

21
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,800
The innocents were under attack.
We did what we could do.

22
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,400
Who are they? Where do they come from?

23
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,400
They were captured by the crusaders.
The man is a trader.

24
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,500
The crusaders must be from
Antioch Countship.

25
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,130
Knights don’t freely transport captives
in the Seljuk territory.

26
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
Well?

27
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,000
What I mean is, the Seljuks must
know about these prisoners.

28
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,600
There were no Seljuk soldiers with them.

29
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,800
Sooner or later, the kind of trouble
you called will be revealed, Ertugrul.

30
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,900
What should have I done, brother?
Turn my back and leave?

31
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,060
Both of you stop talking.
Host them in a way worthy of our tribe.

32
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,030
We will see what the future holds.

33
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,300
It is over, father. You are saved.
You will be healed.

34
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,800
-Do we have permission?
-Come in, Bey.

35
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,060
How is he?

36
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,830
It is up to God from now on.

37
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,500
With your permission.

38
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Come in, Aykiz.

39
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,160
Aykiz.

40
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,460
Turgut’s sweetheart.

41
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,230
I wanted to ask whether
you need anything or not.

42
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,330
Thank you.

43
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,130
-We have been a big burden on you.
-Don’t say that.

44
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,600
Bamsi Beyrek and Dogan are preparing their
tent for you, you can stay there tonight.

45
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,330
I...

46
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,500
...should stay with my father.

47
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,400
Rest a bit tonight. You look very tired.

48
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,960
Your father will need you more
when he wakes up tomorrow.

49
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,260
Don’t worry, I will stay with your father.

50
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,200
Bey, how did you let the boil get so big?

51
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,200
We carry so many problems
on our backs, Hayme.

52
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,130
Will we be afraid of one this small?

53
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,300
If you had crushed its head when it was
small, it would have been long gone.

54
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,900
The jackals used to live in the mountains,
now they are inside our tribe.

55
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,030
They wait for my slightest
mistake to attack.

56
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,160
I hide it so that they don’t know
about my weakness.

57
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,160
It is better to bite your lip
and sit with pain...

58
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,060
...rather than giving them
something to talk about.

59
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,900
At least, you should have told Akcakoca.

60
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,100
I did, woman, I did.
He is preparing an ointment to cure me.

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,200
We will put in on at night,
if God permits.

62
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,560
What happened?
Are you thinking about our guests?

63
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,230
I don’t know what kind of
a smoky candle this wick has lit.

64
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,200
-Did you wear it?
-Yes.

65
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,930
-How is it?
-It is beautiful, Aykiz.

66
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,160
Let me see.

67
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,930
Dear God. You look like a queen
from a palace, Halime.

68
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,360
You look so beautiful.

69
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,360
What happened? Did I say something wrong?

70
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,560
No. I just found it strange
for you to say that.

71
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,100
Wait, let us put the head piece as well.

72
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,600
Turgut Alp got this for me.

73
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,960
Dear God! Why did you give it to me then?

74
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,100
Because I knew that it would suit you.
Let me see?

75
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,330
I was right.

76
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,000
When is your wedding?

77
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,030
After we migrate from this moorland,
if God permits.

78
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,300
Isn’t it very hard to be
the wife of an Alp?

79
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,030
If his heart is beating for me,
who cares how hard it is?

80
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,360
The only thing I want is for him
to be back safe and sound.

81
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,600
As long as there is no death.

82
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,930
-Shall we braid your hair, if you want?
-Alright.

83
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
Do you have a man in your life?

84
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,960
After my mother died, the only thing
that was in my life was being a mother...

85
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,100
...to my brother Yigit and
be a companion to my father.

86
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,200
-Anyway, which man would want...
-Are you out of your mind?

87
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,960
Men would fight, they would turn
the world upside down for you.

88
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,100
When was the last time
you looked at yourself in a mirror?

89
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,530
Wait.

90
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,430
Isn't he the brother of
the infidel called Titus?

91
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,330
Yes, sir. Bisol.

92
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,060
Send these bodies to the Templars.

93
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,930
We will be dealing with Titus as well now.

94
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,060
You! You! Come here!

95
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,530
Load this one on a horse.

96
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,960
-Which tribe does this seal belong to?
-Kayi tribe, sir.

97
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,800
So they are Kayis.

98
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,060
If they are with Suleyman Shah,
our job is very difficult.

99
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,830
Could that shepherd head
resist the Seljuk?

100
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,130
-May you have a good morning, Ertugrul.
-You too.

101
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
I brought you some food.

102
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,100
You did not need to bother, Gokce Baci.

103
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,030
-How is our wounded guest?
-Fine. He should be up in a few days.

104
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:23,000
If God permits. May God give him health
and hope he does not bring any trouble.

105
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,360
I will be back in a while and
we can go to the weaving area.

106
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Alright, Aykiz.

107
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,160
Is my father better, Ertugrul Bey?

108
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,130
Yes, much better.

109
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,100
You will see when you go in.

110
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,930
His fever has gone down. We can take him
to your tent tonight, if God permits.

111
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,030
Did you see the girl?

112
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,430
She already has Ertugrul
eating from her hands.

113
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,060
You can only see him
in your dreams from now on.

114
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,900
Did you sleep well?

115
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,060
It has been years since
I slept so peacefully.

116
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,460
In the forest you said Templars.

117
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

118
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,530
Who are they?

119
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,200
An order that fights for Jerusalem.

120
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,500
They are very strong and ruthless.

121
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,900
Their only aim is to take revenge
on Jerusalem.

122
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,960
If they are so strong,
what did they want from you?

123
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,200
-Is this the Seljuk territory?
-Yes.

124
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,200
Do you have an issue
with the Seljuks, Halime?

125
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,230
Not at all. What issue can
the great Seljuks have with us?

126
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,360
Towel.

127
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,060
-What is wrong with you, my girl?
-Nothing, father. I didn’t see it.

128
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,000
But you can still say
what you want to say, right?

129
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,260
A thing cannot become reality just because
you want it very much. I learned this.

130
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,930
From whom?

131
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,500
We were going to get married with Turgut
after the migration, we yearned for it.

132
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,200
The winter is knocking at our door and
we still don’t know where we will go to.

133
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,530
I understand.
You are as impatient as your late mother.

134
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,600
Take a look around you. Can we survive
the winter on a mountain this high?

135
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,130
Why do you think we have headquarters?
Why do all the neighboring Beys come to...

136
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,330
...our Suleyman Shah’s marquee?

137
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,260
We will sit, we will talk and
we will solve this matter, if God permits.

138
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,400
Don’t you worry about it.
We should not be late.

139
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,330
My dear sweet girl, Aykiz.

140
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,360
They will be gathering for headquarters,
Kurdoglu. Nobody knows what to do.

141
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,530
We will get over this, with God’s help.

142
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,000
Kurdoglu, the mountain is silent,
the rivers don’t babble anymore...

143
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,800
...we have no rain.
We are stranded in this moorland.

144
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,300
If we don’t move quickly our herds
will perish, our babies will die.

145
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,900
Well? What is on your minds?

146
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,160
A horse neighs according to its owner,
Kurdoglu. Our warning is to you.

147
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,330
Weigh in on the decisions.

148
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,330
Suleyman Shah is weak.
He can’t even ride a horse now.

149
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,800
In other words, Kurdoglu...

150
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,500
...horse belongs to who rides it,
sword belongs to who gird it.

151
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,200
Mother?

152
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,060
I came to Akcakoca to get
some healing herbs.

153
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,130
He is out. Tell me what you want,
I will bring them to you, mother.

154
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,460
No, I will come and pick them up later.

155
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,100
Our guest.

156
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,130
Numan Bey’s daughter. Halime.

157
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,160
Welcome to our tribe, my girl.
How is your father, did he recover?

158
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,960
-Yes.
-I am glad. May God heal him.

159
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,530
Our tents are always open for you.
If you have a problem, do not hesitate...

160
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,900
...come and tell me immediately, alright?
-May God bless you, Hayme Hanim.

161
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,860
Not on the ground, not in the air...

162
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,460
...only in the hearts of
devoted believers...

163
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,560
...the One that creates,
makes all creation one...

164
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,800
...in the name of God,
most Merciful and most Graceful.

165
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:02,000
Between the blue skies and dark ground,
let our blood, our clan, our tribe...

166
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,300
...our homes, our sons, our daughters...

167
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,360
...be united, be free, be keen.

168
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,800
In the presence of our most just Bey,
may we bless our headquarters.

169
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,600
-Amen.
-Amen.

170
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,300
In the 99 names of our Great God,
Who creates with only saying “let be”...

171
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,400
...Who fills our hearts with belief.
In the name of God.

172
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,330
Thank you.

173
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,500
My beys, my warriors,
the leaders of my clans.

174
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,960
Welcome and be blessed.

175
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

176
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,800
Thank God that before we set on the road
to sell our goods, a trader has come.

177
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,230
I say that we sell our goods
to this trader at prime value...

178
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,830
...and save from the travel expenses.

179
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,500
That would be fine
if our only problem was the goods.

180
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,530
We don’t have any pastures left
to graze our stock.

181
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,800
They cannot drink water, cannot give milk.
They are all starving to death.

182
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,330
We need to find a solution immediately.

183
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,400
I also see the despair. We sent messengers
to all beys in the region.

184
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,430
We asked for a territory
but famine is everywhere.

185
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,300
Moreover, Turkmen tribes running away
from the Mongol invasion are everywhere.

186
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,200
What shall we do, shall we draw our swords
against our brothers for a pasture?

187
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,400
Is God’s merciful treasure is closed, Bey?
We have been camping here for months.

188
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,360
We cannot find a solution.
When did Kayis became so desperate?

189
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,100
-Isn’t there anywhere for us to go?
-If we cannot find a solution...

190
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,060
...how can we sustain our tribe?

191
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,230
Since when have we forgotten God,
the Bringer of Prosperity.

192
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Our souls are kneaded with patience.

193
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,060
Whatever he blesses us with,
we should be happy.

194
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,860
We learned what patience is by traveling
without a home, Wild Demir.

195
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,260
Our wish is that our descendants don’t
wonder about without a home as well...

196
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,100
...don’t tell us what patience is.

197
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,860
When did I ever leave you without clothes
or food, for you to worry so much?

198
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,530
Never, Bey. I did not mean like that.

199
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,930
Bey, you never let us go bare or hungry.
At the same time we never let you be...

200
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,830
...without soldiers or weapons.

201
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,100
Bey, we say that we should find
a new home and migrate from here.

202
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,460
-To where?
-Anywhere where our sheep can live.

203
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,360
Let us go back to our forefathers’ lands.
They say the Mongols are getting weaker.

204
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,900
Whoever says this is a liar! The Mongol
bandits are like hungry wolf packs.

205
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,130
Didn’t anyone think of a solution, Bey?

206
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,600
Aleppo.

207
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,400
I heard that  Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz is
gathering an army against the crusaders.

208
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,400
What do you have in mind, my nephew?

209
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,230
I say that, we should send
an envoy to Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz.

210
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,030
He should say, “you give us a home,
we shall give you soldiers with weapons.”

211
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:46,530
This way we can fight with the crusaders
to become veterans and at the same time...

212
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,330
...we could have a place we can call home.

213
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,560
Aleppo.

214
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,300
We should act at once, Bey.

215
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,360
Since when do we give a decision
before I say the last word?

216
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,500
I am sorry, Bey.

217
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,000
Do you accept Gundogdu’s suggestion, Agas?

218
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,060
-We accept.
-Yes.

219
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,960
I find it suitable as well.
May it be prosperous, if God permits.

220
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,560
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

221
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,530
Who will go as the envoy, Bey?

222
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,030
Ertugrul!

223
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:37,360
Suleyman Shah, some tactless people in
your tribe has put a smear in our honor.

224
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,100
The honor of the Sultan who gave a home
to my tribe is my honor, Karatoygar.

225
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,330
What did we do to dishonor
Sultan Aladdin and his commander?

226
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,060
This axe came out of the man you killed.

227
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,260
-Did you forget the axe there?
-I did.

228
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,200
You ambushed an ambassador regiment
and slaughtered their knights.

229
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,460
As if that was not enough,
you kidnapped the three prisoners...

230
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,500
...the regiment was taking to the Sultan.
Give back those prisoners.

231
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,060
You talk like you don’t know
our customs, Karatoygar!

232
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,930
We do not hand over guests
who have come to our tribe.

233
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,900
Especially if they are wounded.

234
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,200
I came here as the representative
of the Seljuk Sultan.

235
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,900
You have to obey my orders as if they are
coming out of the Sultan’s mouth.

236
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,360
Or else, you know what would happen,
Suleyman Shah.

237
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,260
We live and die with our customs,
Karatoygar!

238
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,030
We know that the Sultan is ruling
the state but he would...

239
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,960
...put his forefather Oguz’s
customs first, then sit on his throne.

240
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,600
You cannot have a sultan from a man
who doesn’t know customs and tradition.

241
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,960
You cannot be a Bey or a man!

242
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,360
And we would not have anything to do
with someone who is not a man!

243
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,030
You should know this as
a commander of the Great Seljuk.

244
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,030
This was my last word.

245
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,130
You can go now.

246
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,060
We asked you nicely, Suleyman Shah.
You have two days.

247
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,100
If you don’t give them,
we know how to come and get them.

248
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,960
Don’t oppose the Seljuk.

249
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,900
You know what would happen otherwise.

250
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,060
-What is my father trying to do?
-He is too old to know what he is doing.

251
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,930
I told you that it would all be revealed
soon. This is only the beginning.

252
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,830
Stay here.

253
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,500
Seljuk Sultan Aladdin Kayqubad’s
first assistant.

254
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,800
Commander of Haremzshahs.

255
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,030
Right hand man of the Khalifa, Omar.

256
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,830
Now all the Muslim world shall
cry out revenge.

257
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,860
Then it will be the turn of the Papacy.

258
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,030
Bisol!

259
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,900
Who did this?

260
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,330
They ambushed the regiment
who was taking the prisoners.

261
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,460
I said who?

262
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,400
Kayis.

263
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,900
But we don’t know who.

264
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,330
Ertugrul!

265
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,130
You caused all this!

266
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,160
Don’t shout at me, brother.

267
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,030
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

268
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,030
Not your father, nor your tribe!

269
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,930
What would have you done?

270
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,300
What would have you done?
Would you turn away and go?

271
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,430
The Gundogdu I know is not
that kind of a man.

272
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,160
The Gundogdu I know would not
step on justice or fairness.

273
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,260
Justice. Fairness.
What justice? What fairness?

274
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,800
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

275
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,030
Hunger is all around us! Winter is coming
and we don’t even know where to go!

276
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,130
The animals are starving to death.

277
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,400
Justice. Fairness. Open your eyes!

278
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,900
Open your eyes! Look around you!

279
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,000
Right in the middle of the headquarters!

280
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,460
Look at what you did when matters of
life or death were discussed.

281
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,060
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

282
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,830
Forgive me, father.
I could not protect him.

283
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,530
I could not.

284
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,000
I could not.

285
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,430
The world is not left to anyone,
let alone us, Aktolgali.

286
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,530
What should a man live for,
in this world of lies?

287
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,360
What should he ride to?
What should he gird his sword for?

288
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,130
Why should he have a home?

289
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,130
Why do we have states, customs or homes?

290
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,500
The tyrant is going to make the sky fall
on us if we don’t give him the guests.

291
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,230
Wouldn’t the sky fall on us if we do?

292
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,130
If we don’t give them,
my father will be in trouble.

293
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
What should I do, Aktolgali?

294
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,560
For a world where we cannot
even command one breath...

295
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,100
...are we going to give up?
Are we going to submit to the tyrant?

296
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,560
Won’t our customs fall silent then?

297
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,200
Won’t our fire burn out then?

298
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,400
Right, Aktolgali?

299
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:07,800
Karatoygar is a big tyrant.
He would do everything in his power.

300
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,260
Aleppo was a good thought, Gundogdu.
You showed everyone your intelligence...

301
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,230
...as well as the next Bey
when the time comes.

302
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,900
We need to get rid of this Karatoygar
from our backs.

303
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,900
When my father says “customs”
he never backs down.

304
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,030
Ertugrul, look at the problems
you created for us.

305
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,130
We need to convince my father. If we
convince him, Ertugrul would back down.

306
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,830
You talk like you don’t know your father.

307
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,830
He would not give them even
if the sky fell down.

308
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,500
What will we do then?

309
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,100
Your father told me that he will
send me to Karatoygar as an envoy.

310
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,330
I will do anything that is required.

311
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,100
Ertugrul Bey.

312
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,960
Do you have time?

313
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
What happened? Is there a problem?

314
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,860
No. This is something else.

315
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,300
I am listening.

316
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,930
I heard that Karatoygar came.
He wanted us.

317
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,400
-Yes, he did.
-Don’t put your tribe in danger for us.

318
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,490
We can take care of ourselves.

319
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,230
My father is getting better.
We can leave within two days.

320
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:49,490
Even if all the world were against us,
we would not deliver you to those tyrants.

321
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,500
If you get in a fight with Karatoygar,
there would be consequences.

322
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,230
Don’t worry.
We Kayis know how to handle all hardships.

323
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,030
What’s up?

324
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,060
I cannot sleep, mother.

325
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,900
Sit down.

326
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,200
What do you dwell on now?

327
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,830
I fell into a fire, mother.
I fell right in the middle of it.

328
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,330
I would not mind if I got burnt alone,
but I threw the whole tribe into fire.

329
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,800
When you were at the point of falling,
did you know that it would come to this?

330
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Whether you would be facing
those infidel bandits...

331
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,800
...or that said commander being allies
with the crusaders?

332
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:19,030
Could you have closed your eyes and
turned your back to the...

333
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,800
-...cries of that gazelle eyed beauty?
-How could I, mother?

334
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,560
You could not. You would not, my son.
You could not.

335
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,430
You couldn’t have known that it would
come to this when you went hunting...

336
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,100
...that you would be throwing
the whole tribe into fire with yourself.

337
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,430
You threw us in.

338
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,230
Yes, you did.

339
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,060
The fire can burn a dough
and turn it into ash...

340
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,900
...or it may cook the dough into bread.

341
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,430
It was He who took you to
that place you fell.

342
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,830
You don’t have the right to protest
His decision, nor does the tribe.

343
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,300
This is a test from the Great God.
In this test we can either turn to ash...

344
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,030
...or transform into bread. So don’t
listen to those whispers inside you...

345
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,800
...or to the presumptuous people
inside the tribe.

346
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,030
Become a soldier of our customs and stand
strong behind your father’s decisions.

347
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,400
May God never take you or
my father away from leading us.

348
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,160
May God protect you, my son.

349
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,330
Come on, take this water and
put it to your father’s side.

350
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,960
I brought you water, father.

351
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,530
Give me some.

352
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,160
I should have been there instead of you.

353
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,260
I will fight until the blood of
the ones who did this to you is dried up.

354
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,130
I will fight until the last one of
them is in a grave.

355
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,930
You will be revenged, my brother.
I promise you.

356
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,030
If God won’t be by my side on this path,
I will turn to devils.

357
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,130
I will bring hell upon the Turkmens.

358
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,830
I will be their wrath until the day I die.

359
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
I promise you.

360
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,160
Forgive me, father.

361
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,800
That was it, Ilyas Fakih.
I didn’t know how to interpret this dream.

362
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,000
But a lump of fire has been burning
inside me since last night.

363
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,330
There are two options, Bey.

364
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,500
First one is, hard times await us.

365
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,800
The second is...

366
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,860
...this may be a spiritual order on
who will be your successor.

367
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,530
