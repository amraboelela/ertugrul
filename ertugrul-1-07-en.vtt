00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.860
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.200
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.560
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.030
Deal with the loot!

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.360
Come on!

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.200
Shame. Shame on you!

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.230
You did not deserve any of this, Gundogdu.
I told your father.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.060
I said, “if you don’t give the prisoners
I will make the sky fall on you.”

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.130
Now he can make a decision.
Will he choose his customs or his own son?

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.560
Catch him!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.060
Stop him! Stop him!

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.560
The whole tribe is starving.
Famine is everywhere.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.800
We could not even go on a foray. Why?

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.300
Because our Bey has a boil problem.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.300
The whole tribe complains
about your old age.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.200
I told you that I would succeed and
make you proud. I have, father.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.500
My prayers are answered.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.060
Thank God they have.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.300
We have a winter territory now
but our job will not be easy.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.200
Kayi does not seek things that are easy,
son. With God’s help...

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200
...we can overcome any obstacle.
-With God’s help, we can.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.360
Welcome, my brave son.
You came with this good news...

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.060
...may God make you happy
in this world and next.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.200
May your clan grow, may your progeny grow.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.100
Mother, my life.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.060
I would die for you, mother.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.330
May God let you lead us till the end.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.300
May God protect you.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.500
Now you can go and rest.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.560
You will attend the headquarters. You will
personally announce the good news...

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.000
...from Aleppo to all Beys of Kayi.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.360
Then we can talk about
the problems in detail. Altogether.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.400
If you have permission,
I have a small job before I go to my tent.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.830
I would like to address that first.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.360
God, I am very grateful.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.100
Just when all our hopes had died,
you made Ertugrul appear before us.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.200
You made him strong against the tyrants.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.560
Now ordain him to return safely
with good news.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.860
Ertugrul?

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.330
Aykiz told me that you were here.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.330
-Did I scare you?
-I was not scared but...

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.100
...surprised. You came so quickly.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.960
I had told you that I would not rest
and return as soon as possible.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.530
You did.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.500
I kept my promise.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.800
Did you bring good news from Aleppo?

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.100
Is there a new home to go to?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.130
Yes.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.400
Thank God.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.160
The tribe will find some peace at the end.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.530
Everyone was waiting for your return.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.930
Especially Aykiz.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.900
Especially Aykiz?

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.130
I mean...

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.230
...your mother and father. The babies
who were getting cold in the highlands.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.030
Everyone.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.830
All of us.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.560
I never parted from it.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.000
It gave me strength in every obstacle
I faced.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.300
Anytime I felt in distraught,
it reminded me that you are with me.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.860
I brought this from Aleppo for you.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.030
For me?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.430
This is so beautiful, Ertugrul Bey.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.600
I wanted you to see the beauty that I do.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.900
Everything is like a dream.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.800
But like all dreams, this will end.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.030
What happened, Halime?

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.100
What is it that bothers you?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.160
Karatoygar.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.200
He raided the tribe to kidnap us.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.060
He will not rest until he catches us,
Ertugrul.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.060
You can be rest assured.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.360
I promise you that I will never leave you.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.830
AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.830
Today is the anniversary
of my father’s death.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.830
It has been eight years.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.560
I wish he had a grave,
where I could weep and pray.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.500
You should not pray for your father’s
death, you should pray that he lives.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.300
No one has ever seen
your father’s dead body until now.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.130
Maybe he is still alive.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.400
Maybe the hope of seeing his daughter
once again is keeping him alive.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.060
When did he come and
meet with that ominous girl?

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.800
May it be easy, Hatuns.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.160
Ertugrul Bey ran off to see that girl
as soon as he arrived, mother.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.100
Where did they go?
How can they walk side by side like this?

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.460
Don’t think of malice
before you have your facts right, Selcan.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.200
No one would benefit from it.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.230
Ertugrul came and kissed our hands first.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.130
We have to deal with this guest problem
as soon as possible, mother.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.530
My father in law does not know
or see these things.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.360
This girl has bad intentions
against our family.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.500
Let your hands work instead of
your tongues. There is a lot to do.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.900
What did Suleyman Shah say, Bey?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.860
Ertugrul returned from Aleppo.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.230
He got a territory from El Aziz.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.000
Ertugrul turned out to be
more capable than we thought.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.360
Do you think Kurdoglu Bey’s
bag of tricks have run out?

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.230
Of course we have a plan as well.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.360
Wild  Demir,
the heretic’s sword is bigger than yours.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.160
Dogan, where did you find
this donkey stick?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.330
From the Crusaders we killed.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.930
Infidels don’t know
the first thing about a sword.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.360
A weapon should be like this.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.130
It should be curved like aleph.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.400
It should be comfortable on the wrist.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.500
It should be a head to steel.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.960
Karatoygar’s men raided Halime’s tent,
Wild Demir. Is this true?

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:15.960
It is true, Ertugrul. The dog did
his thing but he was defeated.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.260
I entrusted that tent’s honor with you.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.300
How can they come and
raid the tent right under our noses?

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:31.000
You are right, Ertugrul. Whatever you say.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.960
A negligence on my part.
You can punish me.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.300
I deserve what I will get.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.600
I still have to thank you, Master Demir.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.900
Their life were saved thanks to you.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.860
No, not only me. There was Afsin as well.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.400
The man of the trader
who came to the tribe.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.230
But please know this, Ertugrul,
even a bad thing may be a good deed.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.060
If those rabid dogs didn’t come
to the tribe to attack Halime’s family...

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.060
...that night they were going to run away.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:20.100
What if the dogs attacked them somewhere
else outside the tribe?

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.500
We would not have been aware of it.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.260
Halime’s family...

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.100
...were going to run away?

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.100
Did Afsin kill all those dogs by himself?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.230
Look at the helper of a trader.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:08.800
Halime...

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.860
...Ertugrul Bey asked for you
the minute he came.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.960
You should have seen
how fast he went after you.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.030
Turgut and I are going to meet in a while.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.000
My heart always skips
a beat when he is away.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.500
Thank God, they returned safe and sound.
And with good news as well.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.160
Patience is a virtue, Aykiz.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.400
Our wedding will be soon.
My hands have gone cold from excitement.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.560
Did Ertugrul Bey buy this?

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.260
It is so nice.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.360
So he was thinking about
you even over there.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.060
So what if he thinks, Aykiz?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.600
Why do you talk like this, dear Halime?

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.330
It is obvious that
you are not in the mood.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.800
Did something happen and hurt you?

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.960
I had to run away for my all life
so that we don’t get hurt.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.560
This is the first time I am hurting
because I have to leave.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.160
I do not know from whom
or why you are running away.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.430
If you want the truth, I don’t care.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.860
But I know one thing, Halime...

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.060
...you are not alone anymore.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:47.260
Ertugrul Bey would not let you go
or let something happen to you.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.330
Elanora...

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.560
...you are in sorrow.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.100
Your sorrow even made my pigeons uneasy.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.200
I am in the lands where my father died.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.560
I want to pray by his grave for once.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:31.960
Knight Giovanni was the wisest and
the bravest knight I had ever seen.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.300
You were the last person to see
my father before the Turks killed him.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.500
They blinded me with hot iron rod
and left me to my fate.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.230
Before I was blinded for good,
the last thing I saw was your father.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.800
What if my father did not die?

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.430
I buried your father in a grave
I dug with my hands...

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.200
...while blood was seeping from my eyes.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.560
You are saying you buried
my father when you were blind.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.800
What if the person who you thought you
buried was not my father but someone else?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.130
How can I not recognize
the master I worked for years?

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.530
I need to go.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.330
With your permission, my girl.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.930
Farewell, Elanora.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.200
I am going to a mission and
I cannot return until it is completed.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.600
I wanted to bid you farewell.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.430
I will pray for your return.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.860
Titus.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.230
I want you to send this letter
to my sister Isadora.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.330
She has suspicions about
the death of her father, sir.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.200
She is trying to find a contradiction
in my statements by asking questions.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:42.200
I want to be informed about
every step Elanora takes, Mario.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.930
Gokce.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.960
Mother Hayme wanted to ask you whether
your heart is with Ertugrul or not.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.060
You should come to your senses. Don’t hide
in the corners and eat yourself up.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.800
When I saw them together like that...

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.930
So she inquired my feelings?

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.830
This mission is over. You will not hide.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.460
You should be seen by Ertugrul
in every occasion.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.500
Sister, Ertugrul’s heart is with Halime.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.160
You see and know this as well.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.430
His mother might have inquired me
but I know...

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.260
...the son will not want to marry me.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.160
My beautiful Baci, my naive Baci.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.400
Who is asking Ertugrul?
If Suleyman Shah tells him to marry you...

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.600
...how can he object?

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.360
-He cannot, can he?
-Of course not.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.830
When a wedding decision comes out of
Suleyman Shah’s mouth, it is final.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.300
Have you ever seen Ertugrul oppose
his father up to this day?

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.130
Your wedding is soon, Gokce.
Do not eat up yourself.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.100
When Gundogdu returns home,
we can engage you and Ertugrul.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.500
Do we have permission, Yenge?

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.130
Come in, Bey.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.800
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.930
I wanted to see how you are.
I hope you are well, if God permits.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.800
We are better now that we see you,
Ertugrul Bey.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.200
-You got us a territory from Aleppo.
-We did, thank God.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.960
When my brother returns
with the caravan, we can migrate.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.030
-Let him return safe and sound.
-He will, if God permits.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.930
Yes but, Bey...

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.060
...the whole tribe wants a new territory.
Winter is at our door.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.900
What can we do apart from migrating to
Aleppo? Do you know another way out?

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.930
Do you know how many Turkmen tribes
serve in the Mongol army, Alpargu?

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.960
-No, I do not.
-But I do.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.900
Instead of conceding to Ertugrul's mind
and being stuffed into a snake hole...

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.130
...we can turn back and
make a deal with the Mongol commanders.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.130
Why should Kayis be the guard dogs of
Aleppo putting forward their chests...

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.360
...as shields to Templar’s swords?
Or shall we do what scores of tribes...

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.830
...are doing and foray
the Rome territory from end to end?

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.530
But Bey, did not the Mongols
shed our blood tens of times?

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.560
This time will be different!

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.860
We have to risk making a deal with even
the devil for the future of our tribe.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.830
Do not forget...

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.430
...we do everything for our tribe.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.800
Now go and talk with
that simpleton called Baybora.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.130
And don’t let the gimmicks of yesterday’s
child affect you.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.530
Today I will keep quiet and
you will talk in the headquarters.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:06.830
While Ertugrul talks about his sweet
victory, you should shake him up a bit.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.560
This way we can also see
the reactions of the clan Beys.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.530
Let us see how many will join in
your opposing views.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.230
Stop!

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.000
Karatoygar wants him alive.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.900
Take him away.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.130
We will be a burden to you, Ilyas Fakih.

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.900
You will have to put up with us
until the tribe migrates.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.600
Don’t make a big deal out of it.
We will just sleep quietly in a corner.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.130
You are always welcome, brothers.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.400
Turgut, what will Ertugrul Bey
talk to me about?

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.300
I see that you made yourself at home.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.160
Do not test Ilyas Fakih’s patience.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.560
Try to be tidy.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.360
-Do you know what happened back here?
-Yes, Bey. Turgut told me everything.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.460
It is obvious that Karatoygar
has a man inside.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.900
He gave them the courage to raid
the tribe while we were away.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.330
We need someone who will not
attract attention.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.060
Just the job for us, Bey.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.330
Will you do this job with
that body and bandit face of yours?

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.160
Is there someone our Bey suspects?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.130
Yes. Afsin.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.200
Trader’s man.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.530
He stayed in the tribe
after saving Halime’s family.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.200
I want to know who he is.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.500
Of course, Bey. Do not worry about it.
I will breath down his neck.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.400
I came for permission, sir.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.530
Time for the mission.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.560
I will finalize the job that I left
incomplete. I will do it silently.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:38.060
Nurture the feeling of revenge inside you
like a newborn baby.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:41.360
But never let it precede your mission.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.430
Stop the Turks from settling at
our borders.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:19.130
In the 99 names of our Great God,
Who creates with only saying “let be”...

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.100
...Who fills our hearts with belief.
In the name of God.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.160
In the name of God,
most Merciful and most Graceful.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.830
You may speak, Ertugrul.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.300
Our new land is like the ones described
in the legends of our forefathers.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.100
Very secure as described. Surrounded by
mountains on all four sides.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.000
The people of the region even named
the place as Wind Stopper.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.260
Then, if you even squeeze a stone,
water would drip.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.530
It is such a fertile land.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.530
A heaven on earth where our ponies can
freely roam and our herds can fatten...

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.360
...after the harsh winter.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.930
-May God bless you.
-Thank you, bless you.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.100
All problems are not solved
with getting the land.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.260
Our new territory is fertile
but it is also fertile in enemies too.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.530
It is at the border of
the Crusader Countship.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:14.300
While our children and herds grow,
the ploys around us will grow as well.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:21.130
If that is so, why do you talk about
our legends and confuse our minds?

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.230
Yes, Alpargu is right.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.860
-He is right.
-He tells the truth.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.530
We want a home, not a grave.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.200
What makes land a home
is the grave, Baybora.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.300
We should have graves so that
the land can be our territory...

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.100
...and our territory be our homeland.
-Wild Demir speaks the truth.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.530
-Yes, he is right.
-I think so too.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.100
You are wrong, Alpargu Bey.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.560
Did you think the sagas of
our forefathers are fables?

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.600
They are not for making the babies sleep,
they are for awaking the grownups.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.400
From them we learned how to cultivate
the fertile lands as well as...

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.930
...how to melt the surrounding
iron mountains.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.000
What do you say, Kurdoglu?

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.030
Ertugrul is right, Bey.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.560
The presence of an enemy gives us
the chance to be veterans and martyrs...

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:32.530
...praise to God. It would strengthen our
tribe. We can collect booty from around.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.600
Is there anyone who objects?

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.060
As everyone agrees...

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.200
...let the migration preparations start.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.960
KARATOYGAR INN

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.800
Come close, Gundogdu.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.000
I can see the rage in your eyes.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.930
Is that rage towards me or your father?

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.600
I do not like to lie about my feelings.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.330
There is really no need for all these,
Gundogdu.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:36.830
God forbid, if something happens
to your old father in the near future...

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.060
...wouldn’t it be better for you to lead
the Kayi tribe in the future?

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.500
If I were to become a Bey one day...

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:50.200
...I would skin you alive and
feed you to the dogs.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.930
Interesting.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.530
When I came to the tribe, I thought
the growling Ertugrul was the brave one.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:08.460
But it is the other dog
who didn’t show his teeth then.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.000
Bring him in!

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.560
Hamza.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.560
I will give your father one last chance,
Gundogdu.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.560
I will send your Alp,
Hamza to your father.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:42.400
I will gently propose that he should
bring the prisoners alone tomorrow.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.100
If he rejects my offer...

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:52.260
...first you, then the whole Kayi tribe
shall be slain by our swords.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.360
