00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.900
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.000
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.400
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.860
Be patient, my soul

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
Don’t expect a remedy to your problem

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.860
Don’t throw yourself into a fire
and expect your lover to save you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.330
Pearls of tears weep through
the mother of pearl of your eyes

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.100
Don’t expect anything from
the female with coral pearl lips

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.330
Come, do not rejoice

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.600
and cry, poor nightingale

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.130
Don’t expect anything from
the female with a mouth like rose garden

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.130
My Esma? My beautiful eyes?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.160
My silky face?

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.830
Why are you so down?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.300
What is it that bothers you?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.500
Didn’t you like the poem?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.600
Is it possible for me to not like a poem
from that enchanting voice of yours?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.230
Is it possible for me to fall
into the darkness...

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.600
...while you shine my night by being here?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.530
Don’t you know how anxious I wait for
the time we can be together and rejoice.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.900
Well?

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.200
What is your trouble then? Tell me.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.200
I seal my lips as I am afraid
that I might be presumptuous.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.230
My Esma.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.400
Tell me.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.030
-Sahabettin.
-I don’t understand. Sahabettin?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.960
Did he do something to you?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.800
-Did he...
-No, not like that.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.360
I am only a loyal and
trusted servant in his eyes.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.030
But this is my fear.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.130
I fear that I might have sinned
because of him, my sultan.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.800
He trusts me more than anyone else.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.900
All the secrets he hides from others,
he shares with me.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.100
He didn’t even hide
the assassin from me, my sultan.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.460
I was taking food to him every day.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.530
But today...

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.830
...the man...

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.130
...died with foams
coming out of his mouth.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.300
I think he was poisoned, my sultan.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.030
Why didn’t you tell me, Esma?

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.260
I was afraid.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.030
-And I am still afraid.
-What are you afraid of?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.460
If Sahabettin...

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.130
...poisoned that man with
the food I took there...

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.060
What if I gave that poison...

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.030
...and committed a sin by killing him?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.300
It is alright, do not worry.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.030
My sultan...

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.300
...I knew that he was not an
innocent man...

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.260
...but why didn’t he punish him himself?

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.500
Why did he hide it from me?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.400
I have not even harmed
an ant until this day.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.000
-You know my heart.
-Okay.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.260
-I can’t even step on an ant.
-It is alright.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.900
May God forgive me.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.800
What if I sinned and...

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.000
...killed him?

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.530
It is alright. Do not worry.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.000
It is over.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.200
Do not worry.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.530
It is over.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.100
Do not worry.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.500
It is over.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.930
My daughter...

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.860
...looks like the moon.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.800
Her eyebrows are like...

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.960
...a stretched bow.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.030
When she waves her hair...

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.930
...she looks like a pony with long mare.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.030
There will be a feast soon...

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:26.030
...her face will shine up the room.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.200
She is just like a son...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.800
...who will be a valiant Bey.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.860
Hayme?

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.600
Hayme?

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.030
Mother Hayme? Mother Hayme, wake up.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.360
-What happened, my girl?
-Do now panic, mother, it is good news.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.030
Suleyman Shah called your name.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.960
Bey? Bey?

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.460
Bey, I am here.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.230
-Did he say anything else?
-No, mother.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.160
He only said your name.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.960
My girl, may God bless you.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.400
You suffer with us.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.960
You did not stay with your sister...

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.100
...you set on the road with us.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.960
Please do not say that, Mother Hayme.
I see Suleyman Shah as my father as well.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.260
He has every right over me and my sister.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.530
Moreover...

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.900
...I will be his bride soon.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.160
I will call him father.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.360
I pray to God every time I see you two.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.830
I pray to God for a life like
yours for Ertugrul and I.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.130
When I learned that you found me suitable
for Ertugrul and wanted me as a bride...

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.360
...I was honored.
-Gokce.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.960
It is late now.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.830
You are very tired.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.500
Go and sleep, my girl.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.600
I am sorry, Mother Hayme.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.460
I was tactless.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.300
-I only...
-Gokce.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.360
Look, my girl. This is a matter of fate.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.860
It cannot be realized by my wishes.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.360
Fate is what God has written for us.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.830
Do you understand?

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.830
Go on, go and rest for a bit. Come on.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.930
Do not fear, my Shahzade.
You will not be subjected to this.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.160
You come from a noble blood.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.930
Let my Turgut Aga go.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.160
Noble people cannot be sad
over the fates of their slaves.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.030
They can only be anxious for their cause.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.900
You cowards!
Kill me without playing around!

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.800
Your end will not be so easy, Turkmen.
You will beg...

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.330
...but you will live.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.930
In a way I want you to.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.360
I have only one live and
it is borrowed from God.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.930
How can you scare me?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.830
Sometimes people even get scared
from themselves.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:06.460
If they don’t fear for themselves, they
fear for the lives of their loved ones.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.460
Isn’t that so, Giovanni?

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.860
Valiant boy.
Do not trust your youth and courage.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.600
This is not a struggle.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.430
There is no one here
other than God who can hear you.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.500
Dear God...

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.400
...be my side and help me.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:13:00.060
As you get desperate,
remember that God is The Ultimate Decider.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:08.330
While you starve, recite that
He is The Giver of Prosperity.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.030
You are with your God here.
Do not forget this.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.400
And know that you are
in the School of Joseph.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.230
If you turn your back on God
and turn to yourself...

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.530
...they will make you so that
you fear from your own self.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:17.600
I will succeed with this miserable Turk
where I failed with Giovanni.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.230
How long do you think it will take
for him to give in, sir?

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.400
According to the methods in this book,
he can only resist for 40 days.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.130
And then?

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.230
I was not aware of your arrival,
dear Thomas.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.600
You are like the angel of death.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.130
You showed up suddenly once again.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.330
How are our guests?

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.900
They are resting in their quarters.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.330
Are you going to be victorious
through the mice you put in dungeons?

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.160
Even I have a hard time
in understanding you.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.160
Dear Thomas...

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.560
...I do not stick my nose
at your business in Europe.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.000
And you should not dwell
in the matters here.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.360
That is your decision. I am merely
trying to convince our Holy Father...

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.260
...to a new Crusade.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:31.960
I will find Ibn Arabi’s chest and
the sacred relics inside sooner or later.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.930
This is a promise and
the Son of God may be my witness.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.160
But I will not do it
with knights like Titus.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.500
I will do it through people who think
they are still Turks but...

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:52.560
...I shall decide on what they shall be.
-How will you accomplish this?

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.400
With an old Asian legend.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.460
We are about to pick
the fruit of our hard work.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.800
The Vizier is as good as dead
for El Aziz now. Aleppo will remember...

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.430
...Sahabettin as a traitor
who collaborated with the Crusaders.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.830
And I will reveal this betrayal and become
his highness Ameer’ s only trusted aide.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.900
What about Ertugrul?

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.360
I mean Kayis...

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.330
...and their territory?

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.930
It will be resolved today, right?

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:49.030
Don’t you worry about it. El Aziz is
a puppet, which I hold the strings now.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.930
Ertugrul will leave that palace
as a man who lost everything.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.100
No, my friend. You are mistaken.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:04.430
Ertugrul will understand
what he lost when he meets us.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.530
Ertugrul?

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.130
Great God!

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.030
Ertugrul, be careful.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.900
Ertugrul, be careful.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.830
I thank God. You are better now.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.600
Father?

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.830
Father, where is Yigit?

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.960
Did something happen to Yigit,
where is my brother?

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.100
No, my dear girl. Nothing happened to him.
He is with the Alps.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.100
Calm down, your wound might
start to bleed.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.100
Where are we, father?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.960
We reached Aleppo, my girl.
We are at a secure place.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.600
Father, why is Yigit not with us?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.330
I want to see my brother.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.860
You will see him tomorrow, my girl.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.030
Sleep now. You should sleep.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.360
Sleep and rest.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.900
Dear God...

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.300
...spare these innocents.
Bring Yigit to us safe and sound.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.200
The servant told the truth.
The man is indeed poisoned, your highness.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.230
Akcakoca, what kind of a disaster
this plague is?

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.860
Didn’t we kill all those sheep
to fend it off?

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.460
We did, Bey. We did but...

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.600
...this is a child’s doing. She couldn’t
sacrifice her lamb and hid it.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.100
We set on the road tomorrow.
What will happen to these people?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.200
Bey, there is nothing we can do for them.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.030
In a few days they will...

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.160
Will we leave them here?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.900
I will stay with them.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.530
Bey, I know there is nothing I can do...

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.230
...but I can relieve their pain
for a while.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.000
Akcakoca...

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.430
...there are some who don’t want to
migrate. I need to talk to them.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.500
If they stay here, it would be a disaster.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.430
Whatever happens, they need to know this.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.500
May God make it easy for you.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.060
Your highness Ameer.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.830
I brought the gratitude of Kayi tribe
and my father Suleyman Shah’s regards...

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
...for the new home you have given us.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.500
About your tribe...

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.560
...some rumors have
reached my ears.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.230
Are you going to say anything
about them, Ertugrul?

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.030
I talked with your vizier
Sahabettin Tugrul as well...

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.060
...these rumors are lies.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.200
Templars who are not fond of the alliance
between us attacked our tribe.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.830
Those who tried to spread disease
in our tribe and the people...

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.160
...who spread these rumors are the same.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.860
You are lying, Ertugrul.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.830
The enemy who you think is beyond your
borders are actually inside your palace.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.260
You are not aware.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.200
Your highness...

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.260
What are you doing here, Nasir?

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.000
Where is his highness the Ameer?

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.060
Guards.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.030
How dare you?

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.800
Inform El Aziz immediately.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.260
Calm down, Vizier.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.600
This is actually the order of
his highness the Ameer.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.800
He personally wants to question you.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.500
Is Kurdoglu not here?

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.900
I do not know where he is, Bey.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.400
He told me to pack his belongings
and make them ready for the caravan.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.260
He is to solve an important matter
and join the caravan later.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.030
He will join the caravan you say.
So Kurdoglu Bey will migrate with us.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.830
Alpargu, tell me. Your Bey does not
do anything without informing you.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.300
I really do not know, Bey.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.030
He only said that it was
about Suleyman Shah...

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.300
...that was all.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.560
The cart shook him up more than
we expected, Mother Hayme.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.260
You are right, Master Demir.
It is good that we stopped to rest.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.030
The horses will have a chance to
rest as well.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.400
May God give him health,
so that he can walk while entering Aleppo.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.530
If God permits.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200
-Hayme.
-Bey!

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.500
Bey!

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.560
Bey?

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.960
Come on, my girl. Stand back so that
our Bey can breathe freely.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.160
Kurdoglu.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.900
Tell me, why is the Ameer not coming?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.460
I really do not know why his highness
is acting like this, my Vizier.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:04.430
I have insisted repeatedly
but he did not want to talk.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.300
But he gave you an assurance.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.830
You shall be tried justly.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:18.000
And I shall be personally responsible
for your just trial.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.030
You may leave, Nasir.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.860
Dear God...

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.560
...I am ready to be hurt,
but don’t let the justice be hurt.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.200
Do not give the tyrants an opportunity.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.900
The tyrant may kill me if he wishes...

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:08.060
...but the order that shall dignify
Your name may live until eternity, my God.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.100
Turkmen brave.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.160
Ertugrul Bey.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.930
You won’t regret it if you turn around.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:24.300
Efendi Titus says: “The eagle is in
the cage, now it is the wolf’s turn.”

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.330
Great God!

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.430
Tell me? Whose dog are you?

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.230
Where is my brother?
Where is the Shahzade?

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:35.830
Talk!

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.960
It won’t be so easy this time!

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:22.860
Hamza...

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.600
...are the Alps ready for
the security of the migration route?

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.900
They are ready, Bey.

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:35.060
Ilyas Fakih...

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.900
...did you talk with the families of
the people who have to stay behind...

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.230
...because of this plague?
-I did, Bey.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.030
I tried to comfort them but it is hard.

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.400
May God never test anyone
with their children.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.600
If He does, may He grant them
the patience to overcome the pain.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.100
Amen.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.330
Akcakoca...

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.360
...would this plague spread outside
the confinement?

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:07.430
Bey, these things cannot be known
by looking from the outside...

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.230
...but it seems that this plague
is not spreading outside.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.260
If you see it fit as well...

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.260
...there is nothing else holding us back
from the journey.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.430
I see it fit, me may go.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.160
Then...

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.560
...for our loved ones in the graves
and for our babies in their cots...

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.230
...as an Oguz tribe,
we shall walk to our new homeland.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.500
The tribe is in enough turmoil as it is,
why do you summon me here?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.900
I know...

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.200
...Kurdoglu did not manage to kill
Suleyman Shah.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.530
Do not feel sorrow, Selcan. It is soon.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.600
You shall revenge the death of
your father Alpsungur.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.300
Suleyman Shah’s death
will be from your hands.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.460
But first there is another evil
you need to solve.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.960
-What evil is that?
-Plague!

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.060
The whole tribe shall be infected soon.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.230
You have to save yourself
and your son from this evil.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.460
The ill are isolated. The animals
are burnt! What are you saying?

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.900
It is not over yet.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.930
This evil shall take many more lives.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.830
This evil does not have a remedy.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.300
There is nothing else but confinement.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.100
I do have a cure.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.930
You should drink this every day.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.160
It will protect you, your husband
and most importantly...

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.100
...your son from this evil.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.000
What happened?
What were you doing here, Kurdoglu?

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.060
I rode my horse without rest
for the safety of our Bey.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.560
Thank God, I made it in time.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.960
My blood brother, my life brother.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.430
Was it an intuition, Kurdoglu?

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.960
How did you know that something
like this might happen to our Bey?

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:14.530
Mother Hayme, this dog called
Bozok came to me a few days ago...

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.460
...asking me about the
death of his father.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.530
He heard Gundogdu accusing me
in the headquarters.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.600
He saw me as the killer of his father.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.000
He stuck a knife at my throat.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.530
I still pitied him thinking that he is in
deep sorrow, he was a boy of this tribe...

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.230
...and forgave this impudence.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:43.860
But when Gundogdu mentioned that
the Bey’s tent was cut with a knife...

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.330
...God forbid,
implied that he was attacked...

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.430
...I thought about how some people might
have whispered something in his ear.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.460
Then I could not stay back, so I got on
my horse and rode until it was exhausted.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.930
What happened to my tribe in two days?

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.160
Traitors have embarked, Alps have
separated and everything has fallen apart.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.900
ALEPPO

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.160
You have not even blinked an eye
the whole night.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.230
I have caused great distress
with the news I gave you.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.130
You are not the source of my troubles,
just the opposite...

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.400
...we learned who the traitor was
thanks to you.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.230
I worked for our vizier for years,
he is a very good man, he was...

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.900
-...on the right path for years but...
-But the important thing is...

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.360
...not to be on the righteous path but
not to stray for even for a second.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.600
Alright, Vizier Sahabettin
had served our state well for years...

00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:00.230
...but this does not mean that we shall
turn a blind eye on the things he did.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.400
Because of the things I shared, I feel
responsible for the fate of your uncle.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:18.260
Sahabettin Tugrul’s fate shall be
whatever he deserves.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.160
I had personally said that
whomever collaborates with the Templars...

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:26.860
...and becomes a traitor shall be
hanged at the city walls.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600
