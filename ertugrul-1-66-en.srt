1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,200
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,300
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

4
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,100
I don't want my darkened and defiled soul

5
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,300
to dishonor my husband's bed
and my parent's tent.

6
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,430
I want you to punish me twofold
in the same way I treated did Aykiz.

7
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,900
I must be punished equally as Kurdoglu.

8
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,100
I am grateful to Ibn Arabi
for not letting me kill myself

9
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,260
out of grief and commit a bigger sin.

10
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,060
He told me to tell you everything

11
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,960
and so I did, without keeping any secrets.

12
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,160
I am ready for any punishment you see fit.

13
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,260
Our beloved prophet, peace be upon him

14
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,330
said in a hadith that

15
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,260
all men are sinners

16
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,400
but the most favourables
among sinners are repentants.

17
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,360
Selcan wants to repent in the Nasuh way.

18
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,400
She regrets for those she had done before.

19
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,800
She is determined
to renounce her sins immediately

20
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,860
and not to repeat them in the future.

21
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,400
Our beloved prophet, peace be upon him

22
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,900
describes Nasuh repentance as

23
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,360
regretting all your sins,

24
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,930
fully committing yourself to God
and never going back to your sins.

25
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,960
Just like the milk, which never returns
to the breast once it flows.

26
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,360
Selcan submits to any punishment
you decide.

27
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,360
When all secrets were about to be covered
under a veil of lies

28
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,160
Selcan chose to confide her sins
instead of covering them up.

29
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,200
I advice you to listen to her pure heart.

30
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Let Gundogdu decide.

31
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,200
I went to bed with you as my woman!

32
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,560
How could you do this to me?

33
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,830
I gave into temptation, Gundogdu.

34
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,860
Forgive me for God's sake.

35
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,600
Forgive me!

36
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,230
Get up, get up.

37
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,260
I went against my mother and
father for you.

38
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,060
What have you done?

39
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,260
You collaborated with that
traitor Kurdoglu.

40
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,030
How can I forgive you? How?

41
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,800
We wanted to have a baby!
We tried for years!

42
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,860
How could you do this to us?

43
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,600
God, oh my God! You...

44
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,530
How could you do this

45
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,430
to the baby inside of you
out of your greed and ambition?

46
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,330
How am I supposed to take you in my bed
as my woman!

47
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,560
You will leave this tent tomorrow!

48
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,400
I will not go to bed with you
as my woman again!

49
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
I am divorcing you!

50
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,260
No! No!

51
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,230
Please, kill me! Please, kill me
if you are going to say that word!

52
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,260
Kill me if you would say it, Gundogdu!
Take it and kill me!

53
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,200
Kill me!

54
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,130
Kill me!

55
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,130
Go to hell.

56
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,930
Peace be upon you.

57
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,930
And peace be upon you, Ertugrul.

58
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,160
Is Turgut Alp well?

59
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,230
He has always been well, son.

60
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,300
He always fought with the monsters
that wanted to take away his soul.

61
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,930
He was imprisoned within himself.
He was alone.

62
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,800
He could never ask for help or guidance.

63
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,600
The conflict between him and his enemy
that wanted to take his soul was so strong

64
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,200
he prayed to God, chanting his name
in the dungeon they put him.

65
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,360
He has already been one of
the victors, my son.

66
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,430
Now God will have mercy on him once again
as "The Healer" is one of his many names.

67
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,130
I would like to talk to you about Omer.

68
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,260
My daughter.

69
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,460
Are the rumours true, father?
Has Dundar really healed?

70
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,460
He got up as if nothing has happened.

71
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He is like a blade quenched in water.

72
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,300
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

73
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,200
-Father.
-Tell me, my daugther.

74
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,960
They say that the evil eye on the marquee
was lifted after Selcan's confession.

75
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,100
Not only the one on our marquee

76
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,230
but also the evil eye on our nomad tent
was lifted with God's will.

77
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,160
Turgut will get better, too.

78
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,600
If God permits, father.

79
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,960
What about her? What will they do to her?

80
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,260
Can they forgive her
after all the harm she has done?

81
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,830
Nobody knows what will happen,
my daughter.

82
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,460
Thank God, Ibn Arabi is here,
if it wasn't for him...

83
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,230
Gundogdu Bey's situation is
very difficult.

84
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,430
Even thinking about it is agony.

85
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,300
May God help them.
-Amen.

86
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,460
-How is Turgut?
-He is the same, my Bey.

87
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,600
Bey.

88
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,860
My lad.

89
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,360
My brother.

90
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,160
Turgut, my son.

91
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,860
Aykiz.

92
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,260
Thank God for his mercy.

93
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,860
I will leave tonight with your permission.

94
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,860
If you are still alive

95
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,200
know that it is thanks to Arabi.

96
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,530
Do whatever you want.

97
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,930
Be away from me and closer to God.

98
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,300
Sister.

99
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
Don't you hate me?

100
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,300
You were my mother...

101
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,030
...father and sister.

102
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,300
You were everything to me.

103
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,460
But I feel like you ripped
everything away from me.

104
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,300
I lost Ertugrul. I lost my heart.

105
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,360
Yet you killed a human being
inside of you.

106
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,830
My dear sister.

107
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,330
Gokce.

108
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,160
Don't you still trust me?
What kind of a stubbornness is that, Alps?

109
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,360
I do not know what you said
to convince Ertugrul Bey.

110
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,830
But you cannot convince me.

111
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,300
Even your stubbornness is nice.
I cannot get mad at you.

112
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,930
But...

113
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,000
...I don't know what do you have
against me, Dogan?

114
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,830
I do not trust you, Afsin Bey.

115
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,460
I trust Selcan Hatun
but I do not trust you.

116
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,130
She confessed everything one by one
out of regret.

117
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,100
But you are not like her.

118
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,930
I am afraid that some day
you will bring us together with Titus

119
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,860
claiming that he is
important to the state.

120
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,800
You showed up when our nomad group was in
deep trouble.

121
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,900
But heaven knows why

122
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,430
Halime Sultan's father was murdered
after couple of days.

123
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,500
You were nowhere to be found.

124
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,230
Dogan, Bamsi.

125
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,430
Afsin Bey has my and Ertugrul Bey's
full confidence.

126
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,360
You know that he was an
important commander in Seljuk Empire.

127
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,230
We do not want bad blood between you.

128
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,860
Besides, Suleyman Shah asked him
to come with us. Do I make myself clear?

129
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,360
I understood, my Bey.

130
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,600
Not quite, but so be it, my Bey.

131
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,530
Alright then.

132
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,960
Where is Ertugrul?

133
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,430
He went to visit Turgut Alp.
He will be back soon.

134
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,060
How is Turgut?

135
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,430
Thank God, he woke up.

136
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,430
Shall we?

137
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,300
Do you have time, mother?

138
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,360
Yes, Selcan.

139
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,200
Gundogdu cast me out from his tent.

140
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,060
I will look for another tent.

141
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,500
You should be thankful
that he did not divorce you.

142
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,430
Can Gokce stay with you?

143
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,960
Please do not judge my sister by my deeds.

144
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,930
We know what to see in a person very well.
Don't worry about it.

145
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,330
Come on, sisters! Hurry up!

146
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,160
Water is boiling!
Throw in the flowers! Hurry!

147
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,530
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Ertugrul Bey.

148
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,830
Brother, meet Omer.

149
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,060
Ibn Arabi said that he is a brave warrior
honored with Islam.

150
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,260
-Welcome.
-I am honored.

151
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,460
I am honored, Omer.

152
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,500
Cardinal Thomas wants to take
Shahzade Yigit to Constantinople.

153
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,130
I wanted to break him out of the dungeon

154
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,160
but it was not possible.

155
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,430
What about Isadora?

156
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,000
Unfortunately, The Master killed her, too.

157
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,130
She was a brave woman.

158
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,900
I will avenge her father and sister.

159
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,900
Cardinal will replace
The Master with Titus

160
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,460
with the help of the
members of the council.

161
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,560
Both of them do not want Kayi tribe
to get in their way before the Crusade.

162
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,160
They will attack your nomad tribe.

163
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,300
Will they cross the border
and attack the tribe?

164
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Yes.

165
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,430
-May the faster one win.
-Exactly, brother.

166
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,530
We should hurry up and
raze that castle to ground.

167
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,860
Isadora drew everything we need
to get inside the castle.

168
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,100
We know how to get inside the tunnels
and navigate through the castle.

169
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,830
And most importantly,
you will be inside, Omer.

170
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,130
Do not worry, my Bey.

171
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,600
I will do whatever it takes.

172
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,930
Have your fill, my son, eat.

173
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,060
Mother, I will explode
if I take one more bite.

174
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,560
Son, we have fed you
with water for months.

175
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,960
Eat to put some muscle on you.
Eat, come on.

176
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,960
He will be his mother's Alp, my brave son.

177
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,400
Father, I would like to see the
new nomad tents with your permission.

178
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,860
Alright son, you may go.
You would burn what you ate too.

179
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,200
Thank you, father.

180
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,800
Dundar, take it easy and
hold onto what you ate. Alright?

181
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,960
Son, did you hear me?
-Alright, mother.

182
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,230
Bey, what are we going to do about Selcan?

183
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,360
Gundogdu told her to leave his tent.

184
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,560
What did you say to him?

185
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,160
I told him to give us some time
for things to settle down.

186
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,500
What do you say?

187
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't know what to do
or what to say, Hayme.

188
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,000
I do not know after all these years

189
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,100
if we have been raising
a traitor or a dutiful child.

190
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,860
I would have killed her in my marquee
if it was not for Ibn Arabi.

191
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,830
I am not that merciful.

192
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,200
Maybe she was behind everything
that happened to Turgut and Dundar.

193
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Gundogdu is devastated.

194
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,300
He does not know what to do.

195
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,200
Let us wait and hope for the best.

196
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,330
You should rest, sir.

197
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,930
I will represent you in the best way.

198
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Yes, Titus.

199
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,260
What do you have to say about
the recent events?

200
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,400
It was a very big mistake trying to banish
Kayi tribe to where they came from.

201
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,460
We should have killed them all
when we had the chance.

202
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,900
Do you have any suggestions, Knight Titus?

203
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,830
Yes, I do.

204
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,530
We will not rest until Kayi tribe
drowns in their own blood.

205
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,100
They will perish to the last man,
including the babies in their cradles

206
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,930
so that our sacred duty will come to life.

207
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,530
What does Cardinal Thomas say about this?

208
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,830
He would like to host you in his
chambers and discuss that matter.

209
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,560
If you deem appropriate that is.

210
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,460
Dogan. Tell Wild Demir
to come to the marquee.

211
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Yes, my Bey.

212
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,400
Do you have any news from Omer?

213
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,330
-Yes, my Bey.
-Good news?

214
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,460
The news are not good, my Bey.

215
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,160
Ertugrul Bey summons you
to the marquee, Wild Demir.

216
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,460
-What is the matter?
-News are not good, Wild Demir.

217
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,830
How is my brother, Aykiz?

218
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
My dear friend, Petruchio.

219
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,300
Such a great, divine man.

220
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,460
But the crusaders need a young
and inspiring hero

221
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,600
to rally us all around him instead of a
hero in deathbed like him.

222
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,130
And that hero is...

223
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,330
...Titus himself.

224
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,800
That castle must be razed down
on the crusaders

225
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,530
if we are going to ensure
our tribes future.

226
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,800
There is no other way.

227
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,560
They wanted to banish us from these
heavenly lands by using Kurdoglu.

228
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,830
Thank God, they failed.

229
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,030
From now on, their only goal
will be to kill us all.

230
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,530
Wild Demir.

231
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:36,500
Bey, I took a look at the drawings
Isadora brought.

232
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,460
What you ask is possible.

233
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,030
It can be done, but I do not know
how much it is going to take

234
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,530
to open that blocked tunnels.

235
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,560
If we are going to do this

236
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
those in the castle
must be completely unaware of it.

237
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,430
Is this possible, Ertugrul?

238
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,130
If we lay siege to the castle,
we can do it.

239
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,260
If we do it they cannot get out

240
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,000
or send message to
their wretched brothers.

241
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,360
While the castle is under siege

242
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,300
we can dig the tunnels secretly
and infiltrate the castle.

243
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,900
The number of our knights are not as much
as the Alps of Kayi tribe.

244
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,200
A sudden raid will surely
provide us a big advantage

245
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,160
but I don't want to put the war
in jeopardy.

246
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,060
What are you suggesting, Titus?

247
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,030
I will call for a legion
from Principality of Antioch.

248
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,130
A legion of 800 archers

249
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,160
will ease our cavaliers'
and footmens' work.

250
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,130
I will also muster
300 knights from Cyprus.

251
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,900
Where will you find the ships from, Titus?

252
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,530
They are also ready, sir.

253
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,860
I know that 15 galiots
Emperor Frederick sent

254
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,530
are located at the Kyrenian Harbor.

255
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,530
The navarch is going to do
what is necessary.

256
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,160
The ships will be in Alexandretta
in a week.

257
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,500
There are cliffs at the backside
of the castle, Bey.

258
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,600
Access is possible only through the front.

259
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,260
Accesses to the tunnels are
from the left and right sides.

260
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,830
If we surround the castle...

261
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,960
...from here and here, we have a chance
to get in from the tunnels.

262
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,160
Can we get inside of this castle,
Wild Demir?

263
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,330
Bey, I need to see the tunnels
with my own eyes.

264
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,960
You and Afsin go and take a look
at the castle.

265
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,530
Yes, my Bey.

266
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,100
Ertugrul...

267
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
...we must prepare our Alps for battle.

268
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,030
They are probably preparing
to attack us, too.

269
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,330
Reinforce the defences of the tribe also.

270
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,600
You want us to be ready for
attack and defence, Bey.

271
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,430
Gundogdu, you will try to find
coin for the battle.

272
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,900
We need gold for weapons and subsistence.

273
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,100
We can get the necessary weapons
with the gold we found in the tents

274
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,100
of Kurdoglu and his Beys, father.

275
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,460
Our goal will be to kill them all
using their own gold.

276
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,100
May God grant us victory.

277
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,430
The war has begun.

278
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,400
We will move after Turgut Alp's wedding.

279
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,900
I told you that Ertugrul
would cause trouble.

280
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,530
We had a big opportunity.

281
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,990
We should have killed him and his Alps
when we had the chance in the forest.

282
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,430
We could have gotten rid of them all.

283
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,130
But what have you done?

284
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,830
You missed the opportunity
for the chest of Ibn Arabi.

285
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,560
If Ertugrul had died
you would be alive now.

286
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,900
You would be in your office.

287
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,460
It is too late now.

288
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,260
That chest, we do not even know
what's inside of it

289
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,960
has already defeated us.

290
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,060
Only because of your stupidity.

291
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,200
Go to hell, Petruchio Manzini.

292
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,530
I met with Ibn Arabi, sir.

293
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,960
He said that he would go to Damascus
in a couple of days.

294
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,100
He wants me to go with him.

295
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,060
-Will the chest be with him?
-Yes, sir.

296
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,460
That is good.

297
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,300
I will go to Constantinople
with the little Shahzade.

298
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,560
I will meet you there.

299
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,830
Halime Sultan buried the chest here.

300
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,960
I did not touch it. I wanted you to know.

301
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,300
Thank you, son.
I knew that it was in safe hands.

302
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,430
That chest, I do not know
what is inside of it

303
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,300
and I do not wonder about it.

304
00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:00,300
But both Black Priest Thomas
and The Templars are after it.

305
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,130
They quarrel among each other
because of it.

306
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,930
Our chest saved you
and your Alps' life, son.

307
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,100
Titus wanted to kill me
when they caught us

308
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,300
but The Master did not let him do it.

309
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,430
We are alive thanks to your chest.

310
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,800
If you wonder what is inside of it

311
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,300
I would say it is something
that has been entrusted to me.

312
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,960
As I told you, leave it here
until I leave the tribe.

313
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,130
As you wish.

314
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,130
I heared that you will lay siege
to the castle.

315
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,330
May God grant you victory.
May God give you strenght, son.

316
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Amen.

317
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,030
I want to know something.

318
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,130
Didn't you have a twinge of conscience
when you did all those evil things?

319
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,230
I would not be able to if I did.

320
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,600
My father kept coming to me.

321
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,300
I wanted to avenge him.

322
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,060
Now everyone will ostracize me
as if I have the plague, because of you.

323
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,900
Gokce!

324
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,560
You defiled our honor
just like our father did.

325
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,130
You are right.

326
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:06,030
But from now on my tongue will be mute
and my eyes will be blind.

327
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,560
From now on, nobody will be harmed
because of me.

328
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,800
I do not want to see you
for a while, sister.

329
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,060
I don't want to ponder about
your evil deeds and hate you even more.

330
