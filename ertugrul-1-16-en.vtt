00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.720
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.920
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
We tried to stop the migration,
we did not succeed.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.840
We tried to kill Shah Suleyman,
we did not succeed.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.360
Don't mumble,
talk clearly so you can have inner peace.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.880
In the morning you sent that rabid boy
to Shah Suleyman but now we are going...

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.520
...to bid him farewell.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680
I cannot see any logic
in your actions, Bey.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.040
If my mind could only see one step beyond,
my name would be Alpargu as well, my lion.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.880
My name is Kurdoglu because I can
calculate where the arrow will land...

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.960
...before it is even set on the bow.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.960
What happened, sister?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.560
It is good news, my sister, good news.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.080
It is good for you to get
on the road with Mother Hayme...

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.200
...but you have to obtain
a good result from this journey.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.360
You've been looking after Suleyman since
he fell ill. If you carry on like this...

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.960
...during the journey and be
the leading helper of Mother Hayme.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.640
Of course, sister,
you can be rest assured.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.520
My naive sister.
You will impress Mother Hayme so deeply...

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.440
...that she will not even think about
a bride other than you. You will remind...

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.640
...her that you will be marrying Ertugrul
so that she cannot go back on her word.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.920
What about Ertugrul?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.480
Does Mother Hayme not know
that his heart is with that girl?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.240
A word comes out of the mouth once, Gokce.
It does not suit someone like...

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.920
...Mother Hayme to play with the pride
and kill the dreams of an innocent...

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.360
...well-intentioned girl like you. If she
forgets it, you shall remind her.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.240
Sister, do you know why I am always
beside the sick bed of our Bey?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.480
You once told me that Ertugrul
would never go against his father's words.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.480
This will be over after our Bey says
that the two of us should get married.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.600
That is why.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.640
I always pray so that Shah Suleyman
can get better soon.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.920
-He should get better and...
-God forbid!

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.600
Instead of worthless prayers like that
you should pray that Mother Hayme...

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.800
...stand strong in front of Ertugrul.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.120
Do all that is in your power so that
she insists on you to be his bride.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.440
May you find a remedy in the lands
you go to, if God permits.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.000
May you find a remedy so that you can
greet your tribe standing strong...

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.720
...in our new lands.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.040
Get really close.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.440
I ask for your blessing, mother.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.240
I bless you, my son.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.800
My father is entrusted to God first,
then to you.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.200
We don't know who is a friend
or enemy anymore.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.520
There are many jackals on the road.
Be careful.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.400
And may you succeed in protecting
your tribe, your wife and your child.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.960
When there is no peace and unity within
the tribe, migration is even harder.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.720
Your job is very difficult, son.
May God help you.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.920
Thank you, mother. Do not worry, from
the babies to goats, all life here...

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.280
...is entrusted to me. We shall reach
Aleppo safe and sound, if God permits.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.000
If God permits.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.600
Come on, Alps. In the name of God.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.680
May you flow like water, mother.
May troubles be left behind as you go.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.800
May you be blessed with new weddings
and grandsons in our new lands.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.640
If God permits, my girl. If God permits.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.640
If God permits, we shall hear that
my blood brother has recovered.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.440
May God clear your road for this journey,
Mother Hayme.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.560
-To salvation, Mother Hayme.
-Alps will with be with you, Thank God.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.080
But you should still be cautious.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.000
As you know, the enemy is everywhere.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.120
You do not need to think about us,
Kurdoglu.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.560
Do not forget, Rahman.
You saw it with your own eyes last night.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.200
Snakes do not use doors.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.720
Hold tight.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.400
Halt.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.840
How is she, my Shahzade?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.680
It would be wise to check her wound,
Ertugrul.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.440
Press this over the wound.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.440
We should not stay here for long.
It might be dangerous.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.120
We should leave as soon as possible.
We shall find help in Aleppo.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.360
Alright.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.640
Ertugrul.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.640
Will you be able to bear the pain, Halime?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.720
I can, Ertugrul Bey.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.360
AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.960
Please forgive my daughter
as she is innocent, Dear God.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.080
Your Mercifulness has no limits.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.080
You are The Most Just Revenger...

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.720
...You are The Winner.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.800
You are The Most Powerful Revenger.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.840
May You curse the tyrants.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.680
I am not the tyrant here. You know that.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.480
It was you who killed Elanora.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.560
Even if you kill and
bring me back to life 40 times...

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.360
...you shall not get
what you want from me.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.280
You were like this as a child as well.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.200
Stubbornness makes you unlovable.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.200
But I know how to break that stubbornness.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.760
I am getting old, Marcus.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.720
What was the name of the Bedouin
we met in Aleppo yesterday?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.680
The famous Muhiddin Ibn Arabi
from AndalucÃ­a.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.160
Instead of killing you 40 times, if I kill
him only once, would that break your will?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.120
We both know that you cannot kill him.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.640
You are right. You were stubborn and
clever like this as a child as well.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.120
In order to get my hands on that chest,
I need both of you alive.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:47.000
But this does not mean that I cannot throw
him in the dungeon opposite yours.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.440
Will you be able to bear seeing him
getting weak day by day?

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.520
ALEPPO

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.360
Take this as well.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.840
-May it be easy on you, Aykiz.
-Thank you.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.680
How is our Bey?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.800
-He will be better, if God permits.
-If God permits.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.080
Is this your dowry?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.440
The first wedding of
the new camp will be yours.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.520
If God permits,
the second will be mine with Ertugrul.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.240
Gokce, I know that
your heart is with Ertugrul...

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.200
...but you know very well
that he sees you as his little sister.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.800
You start dreaming on your own
and start to believe your own dreams...

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.840
...you will be heartbroken at the end.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.560
You are wrong, Aykiz.
This is not an illusion.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.720
Shah Suleyman also told Ertugrul.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.480
He told Ertugrul that
we shall get married after the migration.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.040
Come on, get ready! Our journey begins!

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.120
Do you think Ertugrul would accept this?

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.080
His heart is with Halime.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.880
You need to be blind
if you don't know or see it.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.080
Please do not be so confident about this.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.240
These things rely on fate and fortune.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.720
Of course they do.
The world has so many possibilities.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.720
Look at Turgut and yourself.
You've been sweethearts since childhood...

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.080
...but you are still not together.
Don't you forget about this, Aykiz.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.320
On the way to the groom's house, the bride
still says "whatever fate may hold."

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.640
You will either talk here and now...

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.880
...or I shall feed you to the dogs.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.960
I know that someone helped you
within the palace...

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.320
...give me a name...

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.800
...save your life.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.240
What is happening to this man?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.400
This is poison!
Where did he find the poison?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.200
-Did anyone enter here apart from you?
-I don't think so.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.320
No one knew he was here.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.280
Even the guards don't know
who they are guarding.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.720
I could not get a single word out of him.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.240
I have to find the spies
who infiltrated the palace.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.440
Esma...

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080
...no one should see this body.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.880
Whoever helped him die will come again
to see whether he died or not.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.480
Efendi...

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.360
...with your permission...

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.560
...I can take care of the body.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.840
I know how to take him out of here during
change of guard without anyone seeing.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.520
Esma...

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.360
...I don't know how to repay my debt.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:11.240
You saved my life once and
now you are risking your life for me.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.640
It is an honor for me to work for
the vizier who sacrifices everything...

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.720
...for the righteous path of God.
You can be rest assured.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.960
With God's permission, the traitor
who did this shall be punished.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.720
Petruccio, my dear friend.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.960
Cardinal.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.400
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.960
I hope your niece's death was not in vain.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.480
Elanora sacrificed herself for our cause.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.560
Was your niece's sacrifice beneficial?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.560
I don't think so. You are not even
a step closer to the lost chest.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.840
Giovanni is still resisting...

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.040
...but he shall give in soon.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.480
I know his soft spot very well.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.200
How can you be so sure
that Giovanni will start talking?

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.600
I can tell our common friends in Aleppo.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.920
-With your brother?
-No. Giovanni is not my brother anymore.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.960
He chose to betray our cause.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.680
And he is paying the price of this choice.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.320
Petruccio, Petruccio,
not only the traitors...

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.360
...those who cannot succeed
in their duties also pay a price.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.920
If you want me to persuade
our Holy Father for the Crusades...

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.800
...you have to take back the holy relics
Muslims stole from us.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.320
I shall remind you of this everyday
until I return to Europe...

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.960
...my dear friend Petruccio.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.920
-What is it, Marcus?
-Titus has returned to the castle, sir.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.320
Get your hands off me!

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.440
Let go!

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.320
Well done!

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.120
You went with 30 knights and
returned with two Turkmen, dear Titus.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.320
Big job, big success.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.440
This child is not
an ordinary Turkmen, Cardinal.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.840
He is a Seljuk Shahzade.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.400
Isn't he one of the Shahzades
you let escape last time?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.800
Well, who is this?

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.920
Your death!

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.560
Well done, Titus. You are
quite brave against a wounded lion...

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.520
...but when you encounter lions in the
forest, who'll look for a hole to hide?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.240
I am going to Antioch.
I have some business to attend to.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.280
I shall take back my guest when I get
back. Look after him well while I am gone.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.880
May you have a good journey, dear Thomas.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.560
Take our guest to his palace.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.800
Take him to the palace as well.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.960
This presumptuous Turkmen
shall beg for me to kill him.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.160
First we shall visit a friend.
He will look after Halime and...

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.480
...we will receive his blessing.
-Alright.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.760
Be strong, my girl. We are almost there.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.840
You cowards! Why don't you untie me?
Are you afraid?

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.640
Do we treat your prisoners like this?

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.000
-Are you fine?
-Save your breath, young man.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.920
They won't hear you here.
They won't understand your troubles.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.840
Here, only God will hear you.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.600
Who are you?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.040
I warned you many times!

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.920
I told you that your personal revenge
should not overshadow your tasks!

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.680
But you went after that Turk anyway.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.480
I lost 30 knights
because of your incompetence.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.080
Forgive me, sir.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.880
Didn't you see how
the cardinal was teasing us?

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.160
You humiliated me and
all the Templar Knights.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.160
Never...

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.080
...ever ask me to forgive you once again.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.520
I understand, sir.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.080
-But...
-But what, Titus?

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.440
Ertugrul was going to Aleppo.
I thought you might want to know this.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.200
He must be going to Aziz's palace
as an envoy of the Kayis.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.520
I shall give you once last chance, Titus.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.080
What is it you want me to do, sir?

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.040
Go to Aleppo immediately.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.400
Talk with Nasir and finish this job.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.520
Then clean your own mess.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.880
I understand, sir.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.680
First complete your tasks
for the Son of God, Titus.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.840
Then, Ertugrul is yours.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.440
You can do whatever you wish.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.600
-Thank God you are here.
-Thank God we meet again.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.160
Where were you, Bey?

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.840
We were worried when you did not show up.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.800
Where is Turgut Alp?

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.240
-Father, where is Yigit? He is not here.
-Keep calm, keep calm, my girl.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.720
I will call the doctor and
meet you in the lodge.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.520
May the Son of God greet our dead brother
in His kingdom up in heaven.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.680
Will his death make our job easier?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.640
Aziz is really confused
about Sahabettin at the moment.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.280
When the assassin is found dead
after accusing Sahabettin...

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.200
...this will confuse him even more.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.920
The rest is up to you.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.000
You must feed fears
and suspicions within Aziz.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.120
I will be a guest of
the emir tonight as well.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.480
In the sweetest moment of our night
I shall whisper Ustad's words in his ear.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.920
He will be my slave from now on.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.200
Eftalya.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.200
Don't get carried away
while doing your job.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.280
I am Esma to El Aziz and
Eftalya to you and your Templar Knights.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.600
I'm only doing my job.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.640
Shall I take the tray
if you won't eat, Efendi?

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.760
Father?

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.640
Yigit still has not arrived, father.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.560
Father, Yigit has not arrived.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.560
May God help and be with us.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.800
Dear God,
please don't leave us in despair.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.280
Amen. She shall recover.
May God bestow a speedy recovery upon her.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.160
Hanim, how is our guest?

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.800
The doctor said that she should regain
consciousness by the morning, God willing.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.800
We should go to the hall.
Our sheikh would like to see you.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.240
Is Ibn Arabi here?

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.720
You can go, Ertugrul. I will wait here.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.520
What is this outrage?
How can you come in without permission?

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.880
Kurdoglu, people are entering the marquee
not by the door but from the back...

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.600
...and you still request permission.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.800
Get to the point, Gundogdu.
Say what you have to say.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.320
I will not say anything to you until
my father opens his eyes, Kurdoglu.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.080
But when he opens his eyes,
not even the candles...

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.640
...even if all the stars in heaven go out,
no one can take you away from me.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.600
In the mean time...

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.120
...a bow and arrow are good.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.200
You don't need to get face to face
like you do with a sword or a dagger.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.400
Welcome, son.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.360
You are always welcome here.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.280
I am joyous I saw you.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.040
May she recover soon. Our master's
grandson told us what happened.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.080
Efendi, when I first came to Aleppo,
the Templar Knights wanted to kill me...

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:41.160
...but we were saved with your help.
I saw you in my dream.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.680
Help is from God, don't ever forget
that He is the source of all favors...

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.320
...and don't ever tell
your brothers your dreams.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.480
His highness Joseph also had a dream.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.120
He told it to his father
for him to interpret it.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.960
What was Prophet Jacob's
first reply to him?

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.120
Do not tell your brothers your dreams.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.000
Do not forget...

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.280
...if you don't keep one secret, the Owner
of Secrets will not give you another one.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.120
I understand.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.040
Look, our guest is here.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.080
He has secrets,
he respects the Owner of Secrets.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.200
May God keep his blessing over us.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.560
It was Sultan Geylani's statement:
"Birds fly with their own kind.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.960
Eagles with eagles, crows with crows."

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.040
Our job was to bring the eagles together.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.960
Thank God.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.840
You are entrusted first in God,
then with each other.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.000
You can discuss everything together.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.360
What do the Templars want from you?

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.040
Brother Dogan?

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.000
Yes, my brother?

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.000
Do you think Alp Turgut and
Yigit will be here in the morning?

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.280
I do not know, Brother Bamsi.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.480
We fended off so many troubles
while we were together.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.800
The Mongols and Crusaders...

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.080
...wolves and bears...

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.240
...snow and winter did not stop us.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.480
So those knights would have...

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.600
I do not know, Brother Bamsi.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.360
My tongue cannot say
what is in my heart...

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.760
...my heart cannot accept
what my tongue might say.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.840
Where is this Bey Afsin? He said he would
be back by nightfall but he is not.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.800
I do not know that either, Brother Bamsi.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.000
We do not know anything about him.
May God bless us with a good ending.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.000
Is it true that there is
a black death plague in the Kayi tribe?

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.920
Plague?

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.840
I was surprised when I heard it as well.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.360
But our commander Nasir said that
he got such an intelligence.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.440
There was no plague when I left the tribe.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.400
But we caught someone who was trying
to contaminate the tribe's food...

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.040
...with plagued meat.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.120
She said that the Templars had ordered it.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.080
Are they under every stone we turn?

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.840
If the news of a plague
in our tribe reached Aleppo before me...

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.880
...it means that
the Templars are behind it.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.440
How much do you trust
this commander called Nasir?

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.320
I do not trust anyone
in the palace anymore, Ertugrul.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.440
When I was just about to catch
the man who tried to kill me...

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.640
Stop, don't!

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.440
Nasir killed him for no reason at all.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.880
That man did not die.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.040
I questioned him when he recovered.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.800
But yesterday,
he killed himself right before my eyes.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.440
What do you plan to do?

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.160
First thing tomorrow
I will tell El Aziz about Nasir.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.880
My nephew will not turn
a deaf ear to my warnings this time.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.160
Do not touch her.
Do not touch and move away.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.000
Midwife, what is happening?
For the love of God please help her.
