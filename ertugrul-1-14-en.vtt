RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.900
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.300
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.160
Talk!

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.930
Who gave you the order to kill Ertugrul?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.300
Answer me!

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.960
Who ordered you to kill
Suleyman Shah’s son?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.400
Has not this lowlife confessed yet?

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.130
He will soon.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.860
We know that you are not alone.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.400
Who helped you inside the palace?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.330
Tell him, uncle...

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.530
...if he talks, I will spare his life.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.560
Answer me.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.430
Who helped you to attack Ameer’s guest?

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.800
It was you!

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.360
Answer me properly!

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.330
Who helped you?

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.460
Who? Who was he?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.030
El Aziz’s vizier,
Sahabettin Tugrul helped me.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.900
Uncle?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.960
What is this man saying?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.030
He will talk soon.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.160
Someone is coming!

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.930
Get prepared immediately!
Master Titus is waiting for us!

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.000
Exercise is over! Order the knights
in the barracks to get ready!

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.500
My father used to say that you were
his most trusted man. I trust you as well.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.930
That is your kindness, your highness.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.230
I trust you more than my uncle.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.030
Please, your highness Elanora,
do not compare Ustad-i Azam with me.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.200
Titus talked about a dungeon
before he left the castle.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.930
Did he want to say that my father was
thrown to a dungeon before he was killed?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.560
I do not know, it would be best
if you asked this to Master Titus.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.830
Before my father died, you were always
with him but you did not tell me...

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.600
...about a dungeon. Maybe my father
is still in a dungeon somewhere.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.400
I am ready to hear and
know the truth, Mario.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.260
-No, both of you would...
-Both? My father and I?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.530
No, no. I meant you and Master Titus.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.600
You are lying to me as well.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.200
Alright, put it right here.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.430
Right here.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.260
If it is ready, untie the ropes.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.230
Children, take your lamb somewhere else.
We need that chest.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.030
You help us as well, alright?

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.600
You old goat. I would have never thought
that Ertugrul Bey would dwell in these...

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.230
...love issues like you.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.460
My brother, these things cannot be known.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.530
It may happen to you one day as well.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.800
You would think that you can stand up
against the whole world...

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.930
...but a pair of eyes would come
and smash you to the ground.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.600
Which girl would like this log?
Moreover you need not a pair of eyes...

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.230
...but a pair of wrists to smash him
to the ground and I have that.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.160
Stop right there Dogan,
stop clowning about.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.530
I need to understand this.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.960
Doesn’t Ertugrul Bey love this girl now?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.230
He should ask permission
from her father to get married.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.560
Are these things so easy, brother?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.560
I don’t understand. If Ertugrul Bey asks
for her hand, wouldn’t her father accept?

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.260
If that is not possible,
we can abduct Halime Sultan.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.500
What does your heart say?

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.860
State your troubles so that
we can help you if we know a way.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.860
My Sultan, he wants to escape from the
hell we call palace as soon as possible.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.860
So that he can focus on praying to God
in the Prophet’s mosques.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.360
Is your desire, leaving behind
the throne like Shah Ibrahim ibn Adham...

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.600
...and to reach enlightenment?

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.800
But would not leaving this post
and going away mean...

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.530
...leaving behind the ones
who trust you as well?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.160
You give your services in the palace.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.260
But what will happen to the Muslim world?

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.300
The owner of this world and Islam is God.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.200
Your duty is to work on the path to God.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.460
I have never refrained from duty.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.130
I did all that was asked from me
without hesitation.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.400
-But...
-What is the despair in your mind?

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.260
Ameer  El Aziz, my nephew.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.430
He is just like a child.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.560
I consume all my energy
trying to contain him.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.860
But...

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.800
...messengers bring news every day.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.830
From Abbasi Khalifa’s palace,
Khwarazmshah’s throne...

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.230
...from Cairo, Baghdad.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.330
Wherever there is a vizier, a mayor who
cares for the problems of the people...

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.100
...they are being killed one by one.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.960
Even in our own palace, we do not know
who is acting according to whose agenda.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.560
Are the things you said...

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.860
...an excuse to resign from your duty...

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.300
...or a reason to work even harder?

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.300
When you continue in your efforts
without questioning yourself...

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:45.330
...God will bring you assistants and the
people whom you will help sooner or later.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.500
My sheikh...

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.000
...could you do a favor
for this God’s subject?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.930
Favor?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.860
When a man asks for
a favor from his father...

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
...the father would say
“give service, my son.”

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.160
Do not forget...

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.200
...those who are ready to sacrifice
themselves for their invalid beliefs...

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.830
...would always win over the Muslims
who are not prepared to fight for God.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.530
This is God’s justice.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.060
God’s Son is waiting for you
at His kingdom in heaven.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.030
You suffered, just like
He suffered in order to save us.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.400
What is inside it?

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.900
Argos. It will take you to God’s Son.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.230
When you see me again,
it means you are on your way to God.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.530
What is the latest situation
in the palace?

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.030
We have someone from us
in almost all the posts.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.600
What about the vizier?

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:16.600
Sahabettin.
His eyes are always on his nephew. But...

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.160
...I have some plans for him as well.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.030
Good.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.300
Soon, death will fall upon
all Muslim capitals.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.460
Everyone will ask for help
from their neighbors.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.560
It is of utmost importance that the
replies to letters that come to Aleppo...

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.900
...are stamped with El Aziz’s seal
but written by you.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.060
Before calling for the Crusade army...

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:52.100
...we should take hold of all
communications within the Muslim palaces.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.300
I understand, sir. Do now worry.
If you don’t have any other orders...

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.930
...I would like to return to the palace.
I would not like them to miss me.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.360
What did you do about the issue of Kayis?

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:08.300
Will you be able to send Suleyman Shah’s
tribe to another place away from us?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.530
When I deal with Vizier Sahabettin,
that issue will be solved as well, sir.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.200
Titus also said things similar to this.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.230
He said Kayis will never
settle under our noses...

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.100
...but they will be starting
their journey soon.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.300
Sir, why does the existence of Kayis
at your borders makes you worry so much?

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.330
Why are you so anxious about a tribe that
can only gather 2000 warriors at most?

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:46.860
When I clear the road between Antioch and
Jerusalem for a new Crusade campaign...

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:54.030
...the last thing I want is
a warring Turkmen tribe settled nearby.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.030
If we close our eyes on Kayis today,
tomorrow they would close our eyes.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.830
Do not forget Saladin Ayyubi.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.600
He was born in one of
the thousands of farms within Iraq.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.860
Then he became a soldier under
the command of Nureddin Zengid.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.030
He was promoted.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.060
He was only a commander amongst
hundreds of commanders.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.230
You know the rest.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.160
If we could stop him in time...

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.300
...Jerusalem would still be
in our hands now.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.800
And I would not have needed to bother
with people like you!

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.960
I understand, sir.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.160
Tell them to prepare the horses, Marcus.
We are going back to the castle.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.830
Once upon a time there was
a famous carpenter in Baghdad.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.000
During his last days,
he carved a very beautiful pulpit.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:09.260
A very beautiful one. From walnut wood,
decorated with mother of pearl.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.460
It was so beautiful that everyone
would be enchanted by its beauty.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.330
The news of the beautiful pulpit spread.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:26.330
Everyone who came to Baghdad would go
and ask him to sell the pulpit to them...

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.060
...to take it to their mosque.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.400
His answer would always be the same.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.060
He would say: “No,
this pulpit belongs to Al Aqsa Mosque.”

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:43.360
People would get bewildered as Jerusalem
was occupied by the Crusaders.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.300
The carpenter would give
the same reply every single time.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.560
This is all I can do. I am a craftsman.
I make pulpits.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.800
Let one valiant warrior take back
Jerusalem, then the pulpit can be placed.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.600
As time passed, the pulpit story
was heard in all the cities.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.960
While everyone was telling each other
how beautiful the pulpit was...

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.600
...the story was heard by
a boy only seven or eight years old.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:26.330
But he focused more on the will of the man
rather than the beauty of the pulpit.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:33.100
40 years passed and he took that pulpit...

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.600
...and placed it in its rightful place
in the Al Aqsa Mosque.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.060
The tongues spoke of him
as Saladin Ayyubi.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.030
These matters are like this.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.800
We carve out new pulpits
like that carpenter...

00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:00.000
...the valiant people who will put them
in their rightful place will come out.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.460
-Gundogdu.
-Yes, Usta?

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.360
If Suleyman Shah would have seen you
at the headquarters, he would be proud.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.230
-I just want you to know that.
-Thank you.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.200
We will break through
this ring of fire together.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.600
Do not forget, you are his son.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.830
When your origins are a wolf,
your heart is a wolf as well.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.230
-Gundogdu Bey?
-What happened, Akcakoca?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.200
There are some things
I need to talk with you.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.930
Aykiz...

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.160
...Gokce is not well.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.060
Her troubles are deep
but she still keeps quiet.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.860
She refrains from talking to me...

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.560
...can you talk with her?

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.360
I see her condition as well, Mother Hayme.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.860
But you know as well...

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.200
...the remedy of her troubles
is not with me.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.530
I know.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.560
I know but...

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.860
Gokce is like her late mother...

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.600
...she keeps silent and burns within.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.530
But being so silent is not good.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.430
Aykiz...

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.300
Gokce?

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.930
Let me help you.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.900
There are only a few things left anyway.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.800
You are in sorrow because
they accuse Ertugrul Bey.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.560
Do not worry, the truth will come out.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.600
Of course it will.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.460
We should pray that they are well.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.800
We could not say goodbye when Turgut left.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.160
I have a feeling that a bad thing
is going to happen.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.960
My mind is always with him.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.860
Hope is the best medicine for even
the deadliest nightmares.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.300
You know very well...

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.160
...Turgut will return to the tribe.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.100
His return will be returning to you.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.800
You will rejoice with your loved one.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.860
But the separation between
Ertugrul and I is not distance.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.900
Even if he returns...

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.260
...even if he sits beside me,
I will be the furthest one from him.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.130
It will be like looking at the sun
behind the insurmountable mountains.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.960
Bey...

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.200
...first I thought it was because of
the famine and did not gave importance.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.200
But, the matter is grave.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.800
What is your opinion?

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.500
Plague.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.360
Black death?

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.830
What do we need to do?

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.300
Bey...

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.360
...I checked the whole tribe.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.430
I stamped the ill animals with red paint
and gathered them all here.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.430
If we exterminate all of them...

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.200
...with God’s help,
we can avoid this disaster.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.930
If God permits, Akcakoca, if God permits.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.900
If God permits, Bey.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.260
Do whatever you need to do.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.960
Find someone trustable
and keep it a secret.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:14.300
The tribe is in the brink of havoc,
we don’t need criers of disaster as well.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.900
-May God turn it into a good deed.
-Alright, Bey.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.260
Everyone is nervous as it is,
why do you call me here, Selcan Hatun?

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.900
Why do you worry
when you see me, Kurdoglu?

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:52.460
You should think about what
you will do when Suleyman Shah wakes up.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.260
That is not my problem, your husband,
who tries to take advantage of...

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.460
...his father’s illness should be worried.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.130
You think I am one of the Beys
you convinced at the headquarters.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.030
Don’t I know the things you are up to?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.460
Don’t lose your breath and tell me...

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.230
...you beat Gundogdu at the headquarters.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.000
What will you do when
Suleyman Shah wakes up?

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.330
Don’t you worry about these things,
Selcan Hatun. I will find a way.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.600
Suleyman Shah will be leaving tomorrow.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.000
They will be going to Aleppo,
to find a remedy for his illness.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.160
If he gets up again...

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.530
...think about your fate then.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.160
What are you trying to say?

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.260
Speak clearly,
do not beat around the bush.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.560
If our Suleyman Shah who sleeps
with high fever, God forbid...

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.200
...gives his last breath tonight.
Even I would say Azrael was the culprit...

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.530
...I would mourn and cry at his grave.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.500
How will it be done?

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.500
Tonight...

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.030
...I will take Gundogdu and
Mother Hayme out of the tent...

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.860
...the rest is up to you.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:16.000
If Suleyman Shah dies, I would revenge my
father’s death and you would become Bey.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:48.330
30 knights have been sent
upon Sir Titus’s request.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.100
Ustad-i Azam, you have a guest
from Vatican in your room.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.460
He is waiting for you.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.930
My dear friend Petruccio.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.060
Cardinal Thomas.
It is an honor to see you.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.100
You should have informed us beforehand.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.930
I did not want to interrupt
your Aleppo escapade.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.430
You are still being the eyes and
the ears of our Holy Father.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.900
His highness the Pope appreciates
your efforts but he has some reservations.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.460
He needs to be convinced for
a new Crusader campaign.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.530
How can he be convinced?

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:07.900
You have to take back the holy relics
those infidel Mohammadans stole from us.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.430
I am guessing you know
who is hiding those holy relics.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.900
-Hello, my brother.
-Brother?

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.160
Very wrong. Very.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:47.330
I remember the day our mother
gave you birth. Shame.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.400
Brothers should not treat
each other like this.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.160
Get out of here.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.600
You did not only shatter your brother.
You shattered your whole family.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.960
Was it worth it?

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:08.400
You went after a bedouin.
And destroyed your wife, your children...

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.930
...your cause and everything else
with your own hands.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.600
But we are brothers.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.860
If you can bring me the items
in Ibn Arabi’s chest...

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.930
...I can grant you your family.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.160
Do you still have hope that
I would serve for your goals?

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.530
Don’t ever talk to me about loyalty.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.530
When you abandoned the Son of God
and sold out the Templars...

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.400
...you proved your loyalty.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.600
Why should you not do the same again?

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.830
I promise you...

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.430
...if you can bring back the items
in that chest...

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.030
...you can see your family again.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.900
I know that you don’t trust me anymore.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.360
For you to trust me once again...

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:29.030
...I can arrange you to meet
your little daughter at midnight.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.160
Is my Elanora here?

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.330
Good.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.430
All the birds are in the same cage.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.260
-Gokce, you go and sleep now.
-Alright, sister.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.160
Sister?

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.360
-Hatun?
-Sister?

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.030
Quick, call Mother Hayme. Bring her here!

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.100
Gundogdu, something is happening.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.800
Gundogdu, something is happening.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:21.400
Alright, Hatun. Alright. Calm down.
I will run and bring the midwife.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.230
Be quick, hurry up!

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.460
Mother Hayme.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.400
Come, my girl.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.930
Gokce, what is the hurry? What happened?

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.160
Mother Hayme, my sister is in great pain.
She asked for you.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.200
I hope it is not a bad thing.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.360
Akcakoca, midwife Hatun,
do we have permission?

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.430
Yes, Bey? Akcakoca is outside.
I hope there is no bad news.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.260
No, Selcan has some bad cramps.
We have to go to the tent immediately.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.130
I will just get my cloak.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.430
-Is Selcan Hatun pregnant, Bey?
-If God permits, come on.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.430
-My girl.
-I can’t stand the pain, mother.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.460
Come on. Keep calm, my girl. Calm down.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.300
Let me check.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.200
Calm down, I am just going to check.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.230
Don’t do it, don’t!

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.560
I hope it is not serious.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.200
Don’t.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.360
Is my Bey father alone, mother?

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.560
No. Rahman is with him. Do not worry.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:29.100
You go to my father, Gundogdu.
He should not be alone.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.500
I said go.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.160
Kurdoglu.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.400
You have passed the Alp trials.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:11.200
You fought with wolves and bears, faced
many dangers to return to your tribe.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.900
You now have the right to carry
the title of Alp with honor.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.000
But now the lesson you have to learn
is much more important than all these.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.000
Being an Alp is not finding food
in times of need...

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.260
...but to stand strong
in the face of difficulties.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.160
Suleyman Shah...

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.930
...Kurdoglu...

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.400
...Alpsungur...

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.530
...take an arrow from your quivers.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.260
Break them!

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.330
Take one more arrow from
your quivers and give them to me.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.160
If you take the advice of
your forefathers and always be united...

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.800
...you would be unbreakable
just like these arrows.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:37.060
From now on never let your names
and selves be separated.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.030
Those who talk about you,
should always refer to your togetherness.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:20.830
