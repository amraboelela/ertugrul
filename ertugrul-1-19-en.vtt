00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.030
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.460
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.330
How will you take me in?

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.400
There is a secret passage that goes
to the dungeons. My vizier told me.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.200
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.030
Do not let yourself go, son.
Be strong.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.400
They will test your will to the limits.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.860
What more can they do to me?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.430
I do not care about myself...

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.560
...I wonder what they are doing
to that innocent boy.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.600
They might have even killed him.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.500
Look, young man...

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.800
...if your body is in this dungeon...

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.930
...the thing that awaits you
is much more than death itself.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.960
If you know what will happen
to us so well...

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.400
...you must know those infidels well.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.900
Because I know them so well,
I am in this dungeon for 17 years.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.800
How did you bear this for so long?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.200
With love.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.100
The one who lights up the darkness
inside you even if your eyes are closed.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.360
Do not stop thinking for even one second.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.900
-Are you a hunter.
-I am the hunted this time.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.460
The new home will be a new and joyous life
for all of us. Especially for us.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.300
-Does Aleppo have everything?
-It has everything.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.160
When we reach there, it will be complete.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.060
We will go and we will wed.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.600
This is my promise to you.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.000
Aykiz?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.430
Let me see?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.200
It is a deep wound.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.300
Thank you.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.960
Aykiz...

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.860
...I was presumptuous.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.030
I broke your heart.
But believe me, it was not my intention.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.030
When you talked like that
about Ertugrul...

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.800
Aykiz, there is nothing
in my hand except my dreams and hopes.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.130
The only thing that
make me go forward is hope.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.300
If I did not have that, I would die right
here, right now from disappointment.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.900
You cannot sooth your pain
by hurting others, Gokce.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.360
But do not despair so much.
My problem is not you.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.260
I thought that as we near Aleppo
I would be relieved...

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.900
...I would be joyous with
seeing Turgut again.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.030
But a shadow is cast over my heart.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.230
It is as if I am getting further away from
my sweetheart, instead of nearing him.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.030
Memories pass in front my eyes.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.160
Don’t tire yourself out
over nothing, Aykiz.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.430
Over all the hardships and
sorrows we go through...

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.900
...your love is like a flower
that heralds the spring.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.060
Ertugrul’s love made you a poet.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.000
May God bless us all.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.560
I only want to meet Turgut safe and sound,
that is enough for me.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.000
Come on.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.900
I am hungry like the wolf, Hatun.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.800
Can’t you hurry up a bit?

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.960
I am coming, Bey.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.100
I made the food you like.
It has been a while since we ate alone.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.230
-May it be healthy, Gundogdu.
-Thank you, Hatun.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.430
May it be healthy.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.360
Hatun, I don’t have time for anything
because of the tribe’s issues.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.930
You are right, Gundogdu.
You are like Bey of the tribe right now.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.330
It is not easy to carry this load.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.360
May God give you strength.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.800
-Come on, Bismillah. Eat up.
-Bismillah.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.560
Do we have permission, Gundogdu?

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.330
Gundogdu.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.900
What do you want?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.000
Control yourself, Gundogdu.
Don’t do anything you might regret.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.860
You stay away from this, Selcan Hatun.
There are things you don’t know.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.460
Yes...

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.860
...these are the things
that happened, Bey.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.430
But as you have opened your eyes,
nothing is important anymore...

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.100
...they will all pass away,
if God permits.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.900
Now, even if all hell breaks loose,
we can put it out with our hearts, Bey.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.830
When we stand together in prayer line,
what trouble can hurt us?

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.060
You have always been with me, Wild Demir.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.260
Anytime I had a problem,
you were on my side.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.800
You are closer than a brother for me.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.100
When you talk about brotherhood, Bey...

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.300
...you, I, Kurdoglu...

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.830
...Alpsungur.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.200
We were brothers. Yes, we were.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.530
Look, we are still like that. But...

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.900
Friendship get valuable with age, Bey.
Old friends like you and I.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.360
Did you see Kurdoglu? He could not hit
a bear in front of him in the old times.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.930
As he gets older, his eyes started
seeing better than a hawk, God bless.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.900
This man is someone who I call Emmi
and our Shah calls blood brother.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.360
But what did he do?
He tried to kill our Shah.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.230
The matter is not like you think,
Gundogdu.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.130
-First you have to listen to me.
-What will you tell me? What?

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.000
How you panicked when I told you
that you secretly went into the tent?

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.300
Or how you went to finish off the job
in the middle of the night? Which one?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.600
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.800
I went to save Suleyman Shah from
the fury of the rabid son of Baybora.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.430
I saved our Bey at the last second.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:01.030
Moreover it was you who warned me
by telling me the tear in the tent.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.200
It was Bozok who went
into the Marquee that night.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.130
I went after him so that he cannot
complete the job he left unfinished.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.430
And...

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.160
...I just came to congratulate you.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.030
Mother Hayme told me.
I wanted to congratulate our new nephew.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.960
The group talked nothing else but this.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.600
Did Suleyman Shah,
our father heard it as well?

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.500
What did he say?

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.300
He was the most happy one.
Suleyman Shah was overjoyed with...

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.600
...the news of a grandson.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.460
Anyway...

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.300
...I said what I came to say.
I should not bother you anymore.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.530
Everything happened as you expected,
Ertugrul Bey.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.560
Yes, it did.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.900
They become a hunt while being a hunter,
with God’s permission.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.930
But the situation is more complex
than we thought.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.830
If Sahabettin’s most trusted maid
whom he sent for me is a traitor...

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.060
...the vizier is stuck in the trap.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.600
If a lion is trapped,
even the jackals start to growl.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.830
We have to save him whatever the cost.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.360
I will be gone for a while, Ertugrul Bey.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.830
Is this the right time, Afsin Bey.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.900
Will you be leaving us alone
in this fight?

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.900
Ertugrul Bey, I know that you wonder
who I am, how far I can reach and...

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:02.930
...where my roots are. I will answer
all your questions and more in time.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.360
But now, we have to pass through a bridge
that is thinner than a hair and...

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.900
...sharper than a sword. I ask for
one thing and that is for you to trust me.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:26.260
We fought side by side, Afsin Bey. We have
a code of battle friendship between us.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.360
I believe in you.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.200
Tomorrow you should go to the Turkmen
carpet man in the market, Ertugrul Bey.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.560
His name is Aykutluk.
He will help you in every way he can.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.830
And I will enter through
the gates of hell for Turgut and Yigit.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.130
Thank you.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.400
Where did those men come from?
How could you not see them, Eftelya?

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
He didn’t have time to inform anyone.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.130
He must have suspected
beforehand and came prepared.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.330
But how could you not notice
those two goat herders while walking?

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.860
Do you have an explanation for this?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.230
I could not see, Commander Titus,
that is why I escaped in the last minute.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.530
Just like you failing against
Ertugrul every single time...

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.500
...I failed to notice his warriors.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.960
You should understand me very well in this
manner as you are much more experienced.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.900
Stop! What are you doing?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.030
We are all like apostles
fighting for God’s lamb.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.460
If we don’t trust each other, Jerusalem
can only be a distant dream for us!

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.900
Moreover, when Sahabettin
is killed tomorrow...

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.400
...Ertugrul will only be like a sewer rat
walking around the streets of Aleppo.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.200
Then, how you take revenge shall be
up to your personal taste.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.130
You caused all this!

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.960
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.860
Not your father, nor your tribe!

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.860
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.460
Winter is coming and we don’t even
know where to go! Open your eyes!

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.330
Open your eyes!

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.330
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.500
You are lying, Ertugrul.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.600
The eagle is in the cage.
Now it is the wolf’s turn.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.130
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.300
...and my companion till the end.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.600
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.500
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.000
Great God, Who has created
the world and the skies, I turn to you.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.330
My aim is to set on a new road.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.830
You are the Owner of
the road and destination.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.460
May You bless us at the end of this road.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.100
My wish is not to be the owner of
a throne, a crown or property.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.530
The thing in my heart,
on this road I set off with Your name...

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.930
...is to glorify Your name.
My only aim in swinging my sword is to...

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.400
...make my weapon a tool of Your justice.
If my heart or mind strays from this...

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.430
...lead me to the right path with
crooked swords, Dear God.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.360
On this road I set off to glorify
Your name don’t let my heart...

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:20.130
...stray to worldly desires. Don’t let
my mind be deceived by the devil.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.260
Don’t let me bow down, Dear God. Let me
and my progeny serve you in Your cause...

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.560
...and be martyrs on this road, Great God.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.460
Hamza.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.260
Yes, Bey?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.400
Take this and load it to the camel.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.230
Look, Gundogdu.
Little feet will be wearing these.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:04.130
With time our son will grow and
be a valiant man, just like his father.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.930
Your heart and mine is beating
right here now.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.600
Everything we have, all our hopes,
our happiness is here now.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.060
He will be our life, our blood,
continuity of our progeny.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.430
You will see that
all troubles will be left behind.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.260
The new homeland will be
a new world for us.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.360
If God permits, Hatun, if God permits.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.230
Let us complete
this migration journey first.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.830
Come on, I have some business to
attend to, you should get ready as well.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.860
Father?

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.960
We ran away for so long...

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.600
...we faced so many troubles...

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.460
...we went through so much...

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.100
But at the end,
we could not protect Yigit.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.860
There is nothing we can do
except pray, father.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.500
Look at the state I am in.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.900
I cannot even get up.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.900
We will find a way in the end, Halime.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.300
God will surely open up a blessed path
in front of us in time.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.500
Ertugrul Bey promised me.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.500
He will not let Yigit and Turgut Alp
be captive in enemy hands.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.300
He will not, right, father?

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:23.600
Your wound is very serious. I beg you,
don’t distress yourself so much.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.260
There is a Turkmen carpet man
around here with the name of Aykutluk.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.830
Do you know his place?

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.830
Wake up! Wake up!

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.330
Wake up!

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.430
Be patient, my girl, Leila, be patient.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.830
Do not throw yourself
into those dark wells once again.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.500
May God help you.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.830
-Didn’t she eat?
-No.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.430
Today will be a difficult day
for all of us.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.860
We do not know how it will end.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.930
No news about our vizier
shall reach Leila, do you understand me?

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:16.460
As you wish. We will of course be careful.
But, how can something like this be?

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.060
How can our great vizier,
Sahabettin Tugrul...

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:25.330
...whom no one can suspect his honesty
and righteousness be tried?

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.960
You are right. We don’t know with
what kind of a slander he was imprisoned.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.260
The only thing we can do for him
is to pray God. You may leave.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.860
God! God! God!

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.560
God! God! God!

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.400
God! God! God!

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.060
Welcome, Ertugrul.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.330
Our mad ones have been heralding that
you were coming from many streets away.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.160
Are all those madmen, beggars and
drunkards your comrades?

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.600
When mayors are being bought
and sold in the market...

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.000
...we work with madmen
in this life or death market.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.800
We need to rescue
the vizier from the dungeon.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.000
It is very difficult to organize it
before a week, my brave.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.130
We need to contact the guards in
the dungeon, arrange their schedule.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.860
Moreover he will be tried today.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.800
In the Muslim world the balance of justice
is not that crooked yet.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.960
We should not lose hope from God.
We should wait for the outcome.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.800
What if it is crooked?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.830
What will we do then?

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.260
If betrayal damages the justice,
our crooked swords shall put...

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.930
...the strayed ones
on the right path again.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.600
But, Nasir...

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.200
...this is dangerous.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.500
Judge Efendi, you were not thinking
of the danger...

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.400
...while you were putting
pouches of gold under your belt.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.900
You were saying the vizier is as good as
dead. Why do you tremble like a leaf now?

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.930
And...

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.460
...think well, Judge Efendi...

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.930
...after the issue of the
vizier is handled...

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.460
...his highness Melik will need
consultants like you beside him.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.400
Can you really do this, Nasir?

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.030
Of course.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.000
You are very important for me,
your judgeship.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.560
It is not easy to find a man
that can be bought so easily in Aleppo.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.800
On behalf of Emirate  of Aleppo,
Melik El Aziz.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.230
In the name of God Who is
The Just, The Avenger...

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.600
...The Prevailer and The Most Gracious...

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.800
...we shall commence the trial of  Emirate
of Aleppo Vizier, Sahabettin Tugrul.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.430
The accusations are murder,
disobedience of an order...

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:01.830
...abusing the trust given to him
and betrayal to the City of Aleppo...

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.500
...as well as to the Muslim world.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.530
I am one of the private guards of
Sahabettin Tugrul...

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.600
...he ordered me to obtain
a fast acting lethal poison.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.400
I did as I was ordered.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.460
I saw the people who tried to kill the
Kayi envoy with the vizier in the market.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.860
The vizier was giving something to them
in a pouch. I am sure that it was gold.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.860
I am a trader, the vizier forced me...

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:53.200
...he used me as a decoy in his business
dealings with the Antioch Countship.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:00.800
Sahabettin Tugrul, you have heard
the accusations, what do you say?

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.130
I reject all the accusations.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.490
The accusers
are false witnesses who are bought.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.330
This is a platform of justice and reality.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.960
With permission from God, these eyes
can tell between the truth and lies...

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.200
...just like they are black or white.
You do not need to worry.

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:32.260
Call in the last witness.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.300
God send you to us, Ummulhayr Abla.
We were going to send a message to you.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.830
-We have a problem.
-Peace be upon you.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.460
-And peace be upon you.
-Welcome, Abla. What happened?

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.260
You talked about an important matter.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.030
I do not know whether you heard about
what happened to our vizier.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.330
Sahabettin Tugrul is
an honest person inside and outside.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.560
He is a valuable statesman
Great God has bestowed upon us.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.460
Everyone knows that he had been doing
his duties in a competent manner.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.360
He is going through a difficult test...

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.330
...may Great God be on his side.
-Amen.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.830
Leila has learned about her uncle.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.430
She is devastated since she learned that
it was her brother who arrested him.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.900
I worry that she may fall ill once again
and turn her back on life.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.200
Poor girl, she was recovering
quite well recently, wasn’t she?

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.530
Yes. She had recovered with
the support of our vizier but...

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.960
How can we of help, Abla?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.200
I...

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.360
...if it is possible...

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.500
...she may be refreshed with
a conversation with our Sheikh Efendi.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:59.960
I thought that she should be refreshed
with his light before she turns...

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.030
...herself back to darkness.
-You thought well.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.300
I shall inform our sheikh
and tell you his decision.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:10.330
May God bless you.
I heard that you have a problem as well.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.800
We have visitors in our lodge.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.500
They are also going
through difficult tests.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.900
A young girl like Leila is wounded.
The doctor did all he could but...

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.960
...the wound is getting worse.
The cure is with God.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.400
If the palace physician checks her,
maybe he can find a remedy.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.060
Of course, I will immediately
tell him to visit you tomorrow.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.560
The girl’s condition
is an emergency, Abla.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:15.060
Do you swear on the Great Holy Quran
that you shall not be lying in court?

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.430
I do, Efendi.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.230
Tell everything as you
told me before, my girl...

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.230
...and do not be afraid of anyone.
What happened in that room that day?

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.130
The vizier and I went into
the room the killer was in, Efendi.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.060
Was there anyone else who knew that room?

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.200
What did you see when you went in?

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.300
The man...

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.960
...was lying down.
He started to tremble.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.960
Foam started coming out of his mouth,
he was poisoned.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.400
He died...

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.000
...in the arms of my vizier.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.230
You may leave, my girl.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.230
We heard what we need to hear.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.830
The verdict is decided upon...

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.460
The physician has completed
his examination.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:20.500
You were wise to inform us. The wound
is infected, her condition is not well.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.230
-I did a small surgery.
-May God bless you.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.960
But we cannot do much here.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.460
She needs to be looked after in the palace
and treated with special medicine.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.300
We can take her to the palace. If her
condition requires it, we shall abide.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:47.930
Physician, can you tell us what to do
so that we can treat her here?

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.060
I do not want to part with her
while she is in this condition.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.230
Her situation is critical,
she may not come out of this alive...

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.400
...we did whatever can be done here,
we shall do the same in the palace.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.400
But only God knows
what the outcome will be.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:08.100
You can be rest assured, Efendi.
Your daughter is entrusted in me.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.900
I will personally tend to her.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.130
Ummulhayl Hanim is my sister.
She will look after your daughter well...

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.360
...in the palace and she was also
the governess of El Aziz and his sister.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.500
Sultan Aziz is like her son.
If God permits, there'll be no problem...

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.330
...you can be rest assured.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.860
