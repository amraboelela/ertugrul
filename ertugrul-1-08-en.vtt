00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.990
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.300
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.930
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.430
KARATOYGAR INN

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.160
Come close, Gundogdu.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.260
I can see the rage in your eyes.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.160
Is that rage towards me or your father?

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.030
I do not like to lie about my feelings.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.560
There is really no need for all these,
Gundogdu.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.100
God forbid, if something happens
to your old father in the near future...

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.230
...wouldn’t it be better for you to lead
the Kayi tribe in the future?

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.130
If I were to become a Bey one day...

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.400
...I would skin you alive and
feed you to the dogs.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.230
Interesting.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.500
When I came to the tribe, I thought
the growling Ertugrul was the brave one.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.830
But it is the other dog
who didn’t show his teeth then.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.260
Bring him in!

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.030
Hamza.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.830
I will give your father one last chance,
Gundogdu.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.860
I will send your Alp,
Hamza to your father.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.500
I will gently propose that he should
bring the prisoners alone tomorrow.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.200
If he rejects my offer...

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.430
...first you, then the whole Kayi tribe
shall be slain by our swords.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.000
I will do everything
a good intentioned commander would do.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.830
This is all I can do.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.530
Do you understand me?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.900
Take them away to the prison!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.400
Eyebrows should be like bows...

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.900
...and eyelashes like arrows.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.500
You should look at your man in such a way
that you should hit him in the heart.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.560
His eyes will not see any other woman.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.830
Don’t put too much.
I don’t want to look like I am wounded.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.030
Do not worry. You will be very beautiful.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
Just like a Bey’s wife.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.960
With your lush hair and apple cheeks...

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.330
...you will glide like a swan
the whole night.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.960
Everyone will be looking at you.
But Ertugrul the most.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.000
-Will he really look at me?
-Of course he will.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.460
That is not all,
he will be hit directly from his heart.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.530
The whole world will know.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.830
Children...

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.200
...once upon a time...

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.260
...long before we migrated here from
the lands of our forefathers...

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.600
...there was a dragon which would
slay our people, rip apart our herds...

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.900
...and kill our horses.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.330
The people were shivering in fright and
asking “is there a valiant Alp...

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.300
...who can save us from this monster?”

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.560
Our forefather Oguz cried out,
“yes, there is! There is!”

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.930
Of course he wasn’t like me.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.830
Much taller and larger.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:47.030
He took his bow, arrows, spear
and sword to set on the road.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.830
You know your task.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.500
Watch your manners, greet Ertugrul.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.030
Bey, may God bless you. We won’t be killed
by the cold, thanks to you.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.100
May your Alps always be behind you,
may you form a tribe with your daughter...

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.160
...make an army with your son,
may God bless you, always be our leader.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.400
Amen.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.460
Look at our tall Alp.
He is locked in again.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.030
Oguz faced the dragon and said,
“look at me...

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.830
...I would hit you so hard
with this sword...

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.930
...your biggest part that is left
would be your ears.”

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.360
The Alps shall play sword and shields
in the honor of our new land.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.260
Let our traditions live on!

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.230
Suleyman Shah protected you, as it is
a custom. Our custom is like this.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:29.160
What about your customs? Does it include
seducing the son of a Bey...

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.360
...where you are a guest?

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.200
What are you saying?

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.530
I said what I had said
and you understood me well.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.960
Stay away from Ertugrul.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.260
Halime.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.960
You are like an arrow which left the bow.
Do you intend to run away again?

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.560
So you heard the things that happened.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.100
Yes, we tried to run away...

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.200
...but unfortunately we could not.
-Nobody wants you to go.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.100
Guests are sacred for us.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.160
This is our custom.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.930
Ertugrul Bey.
We carry the dark clouds on top of us.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.130
We should go, so that the dark clouds
above your tribe can disperse.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.330
So you would have been long gone
before I came back from Aleppo.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.230
Never to be seen again.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.100
I was going to be hurt,
my heart was going to shatter but...

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.930
...they will never give up their pursue,
Ertugrul.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.560
Who are they, Halime?

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.390
What do they want from you?

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.430
It is best if you don’t know
who we are, Ertugrul.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.530
Bey, we caught a leper.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.600
-Kill her, don’t let her live!
-Who are you, woman?

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.200
We caught her while she was pouring
something in the food cauldrons, Bey.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.400
Do you want to die?
What did you put in the cauldrons? Talk!

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.560
The Templar Knights
send their regards to you, Ertugrul.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.360
Put the cauldrons and
this woman in a pit and burn them all.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.130
What do these Templars want from you?
You just told us this morning that they...

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.460
...tried to kill you in Aleppo, now they
try to spread their venom in our tribe.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.400
Everything started with you saving
our guests from their hands.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.160
What is this about?

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.060
The problem is deeper
than it seems, father.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.160
I don’t think that
it only concerns Halime’s famiy.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.900
The real reason they attack us must be
because we will be right at their border.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:59.030
You don’t want to blame them but
our guests have a secret.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.600
And this secret is very dangerous.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.460
Of course they are our guests, we shall
treat them like visitors from God...

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.000
...but don’t think further, Ertugrul.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.560
Father.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.330
Ertugrul, son...

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.300
...you can’t have a tribe’s girl
from outside. Don’t you ever forget this.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.930
Moreover, we would like to wed you with
our girl Gokce, the first chance we get.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.400
We talked with your Mother Hayme.
I found it suitable as well.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.530
Anyhow...

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.960
...the evil of the day should be preferred
over the goodness of the night.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.260
Come to the breakfast table,
we will talk then.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.230
-What makes your night a torture, son?
-Mother, what does my father say?

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.460
Gokce Baci to be my wife.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.130
Gokce is a daughter of a Bey.
She grew up in our hands.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.030
We know her manners, her attitude,
her ancestors and all.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.430
You know all these, mother but...

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.360
...do you know my heart?

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.960
Halime...

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.260
...is here today, gone tomorrow.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.330
We do not know who they are.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.300
They say that they are traders.
Your father does not object...

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.360
...but he knows that they are not traders.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:51.500
They are guests sent by God, he says.
He does not dwell on what it may lead to.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.560
If the promise to the forefathers
is the well being of the tribe...

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.200
...this means Gokce for you, no one else.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.300
Mother, God took me to her with a gazelle.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.930
How can I betray those beautiful eyes?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.800
Those sweet words?

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.260
If, one day, I summon the courage
to ask her whether her heart is with me...

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.460
...and she says “my path is your path”...

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.860
...how can I tell her to go?

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.900
Are you asleep?

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.260
I would give anything
for my eyes to be shut for an instant.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.160
I talked with Ertugrul.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.430
The girl’s father is better. They would
leave before the tribe migrates.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.800
Bey...

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.530
...I offered Gokce as a name to you.
But I am not in peace.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.330
Ertugrul’s heart is with the other girl.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.400
An Alp’s heart is always
with his tribe, Hayme.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.930
He is young, he is hasty,
his heart may overflow with feelings.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:06.560
When the tribe migrates and the tents
are set, those feelings would dry up.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.530
Come on.
May God give you a peaceful sleep.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.200
What a blessed morning this is.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.000
You can be rest assured now.
Be happy that your dreams will come true.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.030
Suleyman Bey told Ertugrul
that you two should be wed.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:42.200
I don’t know. I have butterflies in me
flying around but at the same time...

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.430
...dark clouds don’t seem to go away.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.060
Let out a big breath, get rid of
all the bad feelings inside you.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.030
This job is done. When Gundogdu returns,
there is no turning back.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.600
-Did not Ertugrul arrive yet?
-He did not, Bey. He must be in his tent.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.460
-Sit.
-My girl Gokce...

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.900
...go and inform him.
He should come to breakfast.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.830
Ertugrul Bey?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.300
Ertugrul Bey?

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.100
Come in, Gokce.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.230
Suleyman Shah expects you at
the breakfast table, Bey.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:19.900
Gokce Baci.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.400
I am coming.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.830
The agreement is done.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.960
We will give El Aziz as many Alps
as he wants...

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.930
...and we'll pay the taxes. The territory
he has appointed for us is accepted.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.430
Tomorrow morning leave early
in the morning, send him my regards.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.930
Inform him that I shall pay him
a visit after we settle in our new land.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.600
As you wish, father.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.500
If God permits,
after we settle in our new land...

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.560
...we shall wed you and Gokce.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.160
Well?

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.560
I want a grandson, Ertugrul.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.400
Father?

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.900
With your permission...

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.500
Get up and drink some water.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.160
-I need to see our Bey.
-Wait, let me inform him.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.860
-Rahman, who is it at the door?
-Hamza arrived, Bey.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.400
-He wants to see you.
-Let him in immediately.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.800
I hope it will lead to a good deed.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.500
Bey...

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.800
...Karatoygar...

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.260
Karatoygar ambushed the caravan.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.600
-Karatoygar?
-What are you saying, Alp?

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.400
-Where is Gundogdu?
-Where are the other Alps?

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.200
They all died, Bey. All of them.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.100
-Gundogdu Bey is imprisoned by Karatoygar.
-What do you mean by imprisoned?

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.930
How can you leave your Bey? How?

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.160
Why did they let you go? What does
this snake called Karatoygar want?

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.000
The guests Ertugrul Bey
brought to the tribe.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.460
Karatoygar wants them.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.600
If you don’t give them by tomorrow...

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.960
...he will kill Gundogdu Bey.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.330
These are all your doings!
Everything is your fault!

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.130
You brought those cursed people here
and all hell broke loose!

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.830
Selcan!

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.100
Selcan, come. Come here, my girl.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:21.260
Rahman, send some trusted men
to bring back our bodies.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:26.060
Take Hamza to a tent without anyone
seeing him. Akcakoca should treat him.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.830
I do not want anyone in the tribe to
learn what happened. And bring me Numan!

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.260
As you wish, Bey!

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.900
Ertugrul.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.530
Where is your manners? How can you enter
without seeking permission?

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.900
-Halime.
-Suleyman Shah awaits you in his tent.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.800
Hurry up.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.200
-Halime.
-Be quick.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.560
Numan Efendi, what happened?

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.300
Do not worry, Afsin. There is no problem.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.030
Father?

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.800
Father?

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.160
Halime Baci, where are they taking
my Shahzade?

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:43.930
Suleyman Shah wanted to see him.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.230
I knew it would end up like this.
I knew they would be trouble.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.900
If something happens to Gundogdu...

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.200
...I would kill that girl and her family.
-Stop right there, girl, stop!

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.500
Wife of a Bey needs to be resilient.
Control yourself!

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.830
Here I am, Bey. You called for me.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.100
Come this way.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.030
A messenger arrived this morning.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.400
He told us that our caravan was ambushed
and our Alps were killed.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.160
Karatoygar, who did this,
has my son Gundogdu as a prisoner.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.460
Bey...

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:10.560
...I don’t know what a test like this
is called. May God give you patience.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:20.000
I did not call you here to say prayers or
share our sorrow. As I called you here...

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.600
...you probably realized what those
bandits who hold my son hostage want.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.030
Now, I am going to ask you one question.

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:31.030
And I request a single answer from you.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:35.900
Who are you?

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.600
On one side, my husband and on the other,
the people we don’t know anything about.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.000
They killed so many Alps,
they took Gundogdu prisoner!

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.800
And I am telling you,
they are hiding something from us...

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.500
...but I will learn what that is
then they will pay for all of this!

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.160
Mountains hold the ground,
Beys hold the customs, my girl.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.460
All the things you say is men’s job!

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.930
Because of their curse,
is there a man left in the tribe, mother?

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.300
Go after her,
don’t let her make the matters worse.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.300
Bey, telling you this is my debt but...

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.960
...please know that...

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:30.530
...not sharing this with you is as much
about your safety as well as my own...

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.900
...and my family’s safety.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.100
Bey, if I tell you who we are,
the disasters you will face...

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.030
...will be many times worse than now.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.860
But...

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.230
...I owe you a life.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.360
I am ready to sacrifice anything for you.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:04.430
This includes my life
and my children’s as well.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.530
I told you to give a single answer.
Only one!

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.160
I am...

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.200
...from the Great Seljuk Dynasty...

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.500
...Muzaffereddin Davut.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.330
Muhiddin Mesut Shah’s son.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:30.000
I am the grandson of
Sultan Izzeddin Kilicarslan.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.430
I am a Seljuk Shahzade.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.960
Halime!

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.300
Hear me well!

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.030
You will curse the day you came here.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:59.500
For all the things you made this tribe
go through, you will be accounted for.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:03.060
Do you understand me?
If it comes down to me...

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.600
...I would not hesitate to kill you all!
I will kill you!

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.200
Calm down, Hatun.
Why do you attack like a rabid dog?

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.200
Because of you, our caravan is raided,
our Alps are killed...

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.200
...that filth called Karatoygar
holds my husband hostage!

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.800
If one hair on his head is harmed,
if I have to live through that pain...

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.030
...you will see what
a rabid dog looks like then!

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.200
Sister. That is enough.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.130
Let us go.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.330
We will not go, Gokce. They will.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.560
Dead or alive.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.530
-They will go!
-Selcan!

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.230
Control yourself.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.560
Take her out.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:15.100
Whatever you heard from by bride
a while ago, don’t tell anyone about it.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:26.000
Stay in the tent. Because none of us know
what will happen now.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.530
Do we have permission, Halime Baci?

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.530
I heard it all.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.200
This is not good at all.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.000
What will we do, Afsin Bey?

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.860
The bride threatened to kill us
if something happens to her husband.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.130
We will find a solution.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.130
It seems that Suleyman Shah will not
announce the dead Alps.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.930
If the news gets around, no one would know
what the people might do.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.400
God forbid. We don’t want any harm
on our Shahzades or Gundogdu.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.260
Karatoygar’s aim is obvious.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.960
In exchange for Gundogdu...

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.400
...he will request our Shahzades.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.400
Don’t go out from the tent.
I will do whatever is needed.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.000
With your permission.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:12.060
We have grown tired of running for years.
I ran away from those who...

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.560
...threatened my state with me.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:20.860
From the Templars, the Mongols. I ran away
from all those who want an uprising.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:27.130
I ran away from those who pursue me
for the survival of my state.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:33.130
And I ran away from my state so that
my valiant son would not be harmed.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.960
Bey...

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.400
...it has been years since
I have given up on my own life.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.300
So this is the end,
it is time to put an end to all this.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.400
Karatoygar wants an exchange, father.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.330
But even if we give him what he wants...

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.100
...he would kill you.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.000
His rage against you will not subside
after he gets the Shahzades.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.360
He will kill you and my brother as well.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.600
You are right, my son.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.600
First...

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.500
...we have to find a way
to save Gundogdu from him.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.400
Not only my brother.
I would not hand you over to him, father.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:19.230
If I attack with my Alps,
he would kill Gundogdu immediately.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.860
And with the blood that would be spilt,
the tribe cannot stand strong again.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.600
We would fall apart.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.530
First you have to convince him
to free my brother, father.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.330
Then convince him to come out of his fort.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.530
If he wants an exchange, we set the rules.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.830
-Why would he free Gundogdu?
-He has to, father.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.860
Why did the Templars
try to kill me in Aleppo?

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.200
Why did they send a leper woman
to poison the tribe?

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.600
Why were the Templars were taking
the Shahzades to Karatoygar?

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:56.530
They wanted Karatoygar to be appointed
to an important post in the palace...

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.230
...and for him to serve them
at the palace.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.560
Karatoygar is after the Shahzades, father.
He would do everything to get them...

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.260
...we just need to know how to ask for it.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.960
What if something goes wrong?

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.830
Then we all die, father.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.430
But at least we would die holding a sword
in our hands and honor in our hearts.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.900
