00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.960
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.030
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.530
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.900
Mother Hayme, why do you take
this ominous girl into your tent?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.430
Aren’t they the source of all problems
we are facing today?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.300
How can she have the face
to stay in our tribe?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.830
How can she sit in our marquee?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.560
How dare you question my decisions?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.230
Get out of here now! I said now!

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.130
Beys, come on, let us talk inside.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.930
Everyone in the tribe is informed.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.160
What is happening?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.100
How dare you enter your Bey’s
marquee like this?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.300
They wanted to talk with their Bey,
Hayme Hanim.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.000
And I accepted their request.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.960
State comes first or
else you get eaten by crows.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.400
Walk. I said walk along!

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.030
Whatever happens do not show yourselves.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.460
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.530
Walk.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.900
Send the Shahzades, Ertugrul.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.030
And you send my father!

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.230
Come on.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.260
Kill them all!

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.100
Kill them all!

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.560
What if Suleyman Shah does not come back?
What will we do, Bey?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.100
Bey, what can we do if this Karatoygar
is not satisfied attacks the tribe later?

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.030
We see that the tribe has
so many endless problems.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.830
We did not know...

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.330
...that the beys who have
many jobs to do are anxious to...

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.430
...gather the headquarter meetings
every chance they get.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.530
For you to show your courage, you wait
for your Bey to sacrifice himself.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.030
We were not aware of this, until now.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.460
If Suleyman Shah who returned from
countless battles tired and sweaty...

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.300
...saw you in this manner,
I am sure he would have been proud.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.000
Kill them all!

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.230
Why aren’t you attacking?

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.860
Why?

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.860
Take them away.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.100
I told you to kill them all!

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.560
Kill them all!

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.830
This is treachery! Treachery!

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.960
You cowards! You will pay for all this!

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.230
Attack!

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.430
Your brother is still in my hand,
Ertugrul!

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.460
If something happens to me...

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.500
Save your breath, Karatoygar.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.600
No one will come to your help.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.160
I want to talk with you alone,
Ertugrul Bey.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.160
Leave us alone, Alps.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.900
I was a commander in the Seljuk army
for years.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.400
For the Great Seljuk state
I fought inside and outside the country.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.430
I spilt blood, then fate flew me
to my Shahzade.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.200
From now on, my only wish, my only duty
is to protect my Shahzade and his family.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.900
That is why I contacted with the soldiers
I know within Karatoygar’s legion.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.200
That is the situation, Ertugrul Bey.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.500
This is what I want as well, Afsin Bey.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.430
To protect my tribe, my family, Halime...

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.260
...and Halime’s family.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.830
As our wish and desires are the same...

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.560
...we should stand as strong as mountains
against this dog called Karatoygar.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.260
You are a valiant man, Ertugrul Bey...

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.060
...to fight side by side with you
is a pride, an honor for me.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.160
Then tell me, Afsin Bey.
Those soldiers you are in contact with.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.160
How effective are they?

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.100
Let me tell you like this, Ertugrul Bey...

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.400
...they are so effective that
when Karatoygar calls for help...

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.330
...he will not find
a single soldier behind him.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.560
Then our job is to make him call for help.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.230
This means that in the life and death
situation at Kartal Tepesi...

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.360
...we shall be the sword and
you shall be the shield, Afsin Bey.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.160
We will attack and you will keep
the Seljuk soldiers with Karatoygar...

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.160
...on the right side.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.900
Of course, Ertugrul Bey. We shall be.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.860
Today, we shall be on the side of
the oppressed against the tyrants.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.300
The Owner of the oppressed is our Witness.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.160
May God be on our side and help us.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.830
Sari Bolu.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.030
Sari Bolu!

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.530
You will pay for this.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.260
You lowlife scum!

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.930
May you burn in hell, Karatoygar.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:13.060
You will all die along with the Shahzades.
I shall exterminate your progeny!

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.360
Those days are over, Mother Hayme.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.300
It is time to think about
how we will pass the cliff in front of us.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.160
Alpargu! Know your place!

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.100
Of course we have things to talk about,
for the future of our tribe.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.030
But this place is also
the private quarters of our Suleyman Shah.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.130
It is not suitable to bother Mother Hayme.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.360
She is in enough pain as it is.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.260
We were inconsiderate.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.830
Let us carry on in my tent.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.530
Carry the Bey symbols to my tent.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.960
We are all sorry for our losses, brother.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.460
The ambush on the caravan, the Alps
getting killed were not your fault.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.930
Did you know beforehand?

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.260
Did you know that Numan was
a Shahzade beforehand?

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.130
No, I just learned it.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.360
But it is obvious that
they had a good reason to hide it.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.160
He played you just like he played us...

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.300
...but you still defend them!

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.600
Let me go, you goat herders!

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.560
Who do you think you are?

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.000
Let me go!

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.600
Banditry is not eternal, Karatoygar.
Your tyrant rule is over.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.330
You talk about banditry.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:44.060
The Turkmen tribe who ambushed
and captured a Seljuk commander.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:53.430
When Sultan Aladdin hears about this,
who do you think he will see as bandits?

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.930
Do not waste your breath, Karatoygar.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.900
We will set a court and your verdict
will be given according to our customs.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.430
When custom speaks, Beys stop talking,
as well as the sultan.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.060
-Father?
-Are you fine, Bey?

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.330
Would you like to rest a bit?

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.360
I am fine, Wild Demir. I am fine.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.100
Are we returning to the tribe, father?

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.000
No. First we will take back the goods
this lowlife looted from our caravan.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.530
Afsin Bey,
you know that I would die for you...

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.230
...but what if this court ruling goes bad?

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.260
Do not worry, Sari. Trust me.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.400
It is obvious that Kurdoglu
was waiting for a chance like this.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.560
How else could he act so quickly
to take over the post?

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.000
Shameless man.
He even took the Bey symbols with him.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.000
And we are sitting here
with our hands tied.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.960
Enough, Aykiz. Enough.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.230
You make a fuss without
knowing how the state is run.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.300
-Do we have permission, Mother Hayme?
-Come, my girl. Come.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.960
What happened?

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:46.360
You all wait with the pain inside you,
you do not think about your hunger.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.200
I wanted to bring you something to eat.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.930
Thank you, my girl. Put the pan on
the table and you sit down with us.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.330
We all wait with anxiety.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.830
While Suleyman Shah is leading them,
they will all come back safe and sound.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.130
But my sister is worrying a lot
about my brother in law Gundogdu.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.460
You all wait for your fathers...

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.060
...and I pray for Ertugrul Bey.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.560
You are correct.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.030
I know the sorrow your sister
is going through.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.430
But let her be rest assured...

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.230
...we shall leave the tribe soon.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.960
If God permits, they will all
return safe and sound.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.060
We can only pray for them.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.400
You bloodless dogs. Lowlifes!

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.200
I will kill you all! Kill you all.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.930
You will pay for all of these!
I will destroy you all!

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:04.260
Not only your tribe, there will be not
a single person left who remembers Kayis.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.030
I will kill you all!

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:18.100
You shall leave immediately.
You will catch that dog called Gundogdu...

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.400
...before he reaches his tribe...

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.960
...and you'll bring him to Kartal Tepesi.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.060
-Kartal Tepesi?
-Kartal Tepesi, yes.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.300
Those Kayi goat herders are
setting us a trap there.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:42.160
Did you hear, Sari?
They think they can finish Karatoygar off.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.530
Bey, if you like we can go beforehand
take precautions.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.530
Yes, Sari Bolu...

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:56.300
...place your most trusted
soldiers to the rocks of Kartal Tepesi.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.300
When I give the signal...

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.230
...I want to turn that place
into hell for Kayis.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.360
As you wish!

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.930
Sari Bolu.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.060
We checked the warehouse where
the goods are, they are all there, Bey.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.930
Are you fine, father?

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.560
Yes, I am.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.130
Bey, you are tired...

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.100
...I arranged a room for you to stay here
and rest for the night.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.830
We can go there if you wish.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.300
Thank you, commander.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.960
Ertugrul...

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.130
...you stay here. I will go with Gundogdu.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.400
Ertugrul Bey...

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.230
...there are some issues
we need to talk about.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.900
As if the problems they created for us
are not enough...

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.200
...she goes and takes refuge with
Mother Hayme. Wolf in a sheep’s hide.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.130
But if my name is Selcan, I shall make you
pay for all you have done, Halime.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.430
Sister.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.900
Gokce, where were you?
Which corner did you hide in?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.060
Sister.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.560
The foreign girl goes and takes refuge
with Mother Hayme but my sister is...

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.030
...all alone in a corner...
-Sister! You are mistaken!

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.230
I am not hiding anywhere.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.260
I am coming from the marquee,
I was with them.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.360
Look at my sister.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.860
I approached them with
an excuse of bringing food.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.200
I said what I had to say and
I heard what I wanted to hear.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.930
What did you hear?

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.160
Kurdoglu took the Bey symbols
and carried them to his tent.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.930
It is obvious that they lost hope of
Suleyman Shah’s return.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.960
-Did he take the Bey symbols to his tent?
-Yes.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.330
Kurdoglu.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.100
What is your intention?

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.530
You wait here.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.130
Sister!

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.830
Stop, Gundogdu.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.860
Today, I saw how you looked at Ertugrul.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.160
You are his brother.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.200
A brother should not look
at his brother with hatred.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.200
Moreover, he risked his life to save you.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.360
Father, what are you saying?

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.600
He risked his life, is that so?

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:51.960
I do not know whether he risked his life
for us or for his valuable guests...

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.160
...but I know one thing, if we were
put in this bind, Ertugrul is the reason.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.030
You have hate in your eyes
after the ambush on the caravan.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.300
You look for a scapegoat to blame.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.960
Are you comfortable, Kurdoglu?

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.960
Are you satisfied with sitting on Suleyman
Shah’s throne instead of saving Gundogdu?

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.400
I do not reply as I know
you worry about your husband’s life...

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.000
...but know your place, Selcan Hatun.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.260
I know my place,
that is why I am questioning you!

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.830
Why don’t you do anything
to save Gundogdu?

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.460
Do you see what is going on in this tribe?
Do you hear them?

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.330
We faced many problems, if I didn’t act
fast the tribe was going to be divided.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.830
Who was to blame for those many problems?
Wasn’t it you who stirred up the trouble?

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.330
I told you the things Suleyman Shah was
keeping secret, I committed an offence...

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.130
...but what did you do? Nothing!
-What did you expect me to do?

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.300
Do you see me as a traitor? Did you think
that I would share the secret plans...

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.330
...of my tribe with the enemy?

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.460
What will happen to them?

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.460
If that dog called Karatoygar
kills my husband...

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.230
We will pray for them to be spared.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.500
This is all we can do.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.430
We need to get out of the Seljuk territory
before all hell breaks loose again.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:26.000
Not for myself, for my son who sleeps
unbeknown to all that is happening.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.430
I understand you, my Shahzade. I guess
this is the best course of action...

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.060
...for the good of everyone.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.200
But you may need to give us
horses and weapons for us to go.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.500
I have another plan in my mind.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.460
After the funerals, I shall request
permission from my father to go to Aleppo.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.400
I can take you there
safe and sound with my Alps.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.930
-After that...
-Thank you, Ertugrul Bey. Thank you.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.200
I shall always be thankful to you
and your family.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.600
Tomorrow we shall talk with Suleyman Shah
and set on the road as soon as possible.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.300
Ertugrul?

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.930
You are not asleep.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.800
You are not asleep either.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.030
We managed to win this time as well...

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.930
...but there is something eating
my heart from inside, Wild  Demir.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.160
How did Karatoygar learn that
we were at Kartal Tepesi?

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.560
The thing that is eating your heart inside
is eating my heart as well.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.030
Look...

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.230
...I will say something to you but...

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.130
Tell me, Wild  Demir.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:28.860
That night when those dogs
staged an ambush on Halime’s tent...

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.460
...the person who drove me away
from the tent...

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.000
...was Kurdoglu.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.600
I don’t want to blame anyone
without proof, even Kurdoglu but...

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.260
...this is a problem of the tribe.
You should be informed.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.330
AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.830
-You have a message from Titus, sir.
-What did he write?

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.960
Fools.
They could not do one thing properly.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.200
Check...

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.360
...and mate.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.990
Do not forget, when the game ends...

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.200
...the king and pawns
are put in the same box at the end.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:53.200
Only the ones who clear the table
know who is victorious.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:02.200
Be careful and don’t make me angry
before you go in the box.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.230
Send a message to Titus, immediately.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.800
He should not sacrifice
Karatoygar for anyone.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.330
Can Titus still prevent
Kayis from coming to Aleppo?

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:20.100
I do not know where he can succeed or not.
Not being able to see the future...

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.460
...is torturing my soul.
Tell them to get prepared, Marcus.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.030
You are coming with me to Aleppo.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.060
We have some business to attend
with Nasir.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.200
Do you have any other
orders for Titus, sir?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.200
He should make the wrath of Karatoygar
fall upon the Kayis.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.060
He can either do this himself
or use Kurdoglu.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.130
This shall be his decision,
as he will be responsible for the outcome.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:08.260
Where is Suleyman Shah?
They say that our caravan was ambushed.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.330
Where are the bodies, Bey?

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:15.400
He is right. Where is Bey, where are
the bodies? What is happening, Kurdoglu?

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:20.460
Beys of Kayi.
Today is not the day for complaints.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.460
We still have no news from our tribe’s
pillar Suleyman Shah and our Alps.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.530
God forbid, we need to be prepared
for all possibilities.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.560
The unity and future of
our tribe is under threat.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.030
And this Aleppo issue
in the middle of all these troubles.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.960
The decision our Bey took in good times...

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.360
...should be reconsidered under
these harsh conditions.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.000
What else can we do, Kurdoglu?
What is on your mind?

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.600
Before I state the thing on my mind,
I would like to remind you that...

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.360
...Suleyman Shah Bey appointed me as
the head of the tribe before leaving.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:08.600
-My words are our Bey’s words.
-Of course.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:17.960
My heart is not in peace with setting foot
on the unknown path of Aleppo.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360
To migrate, we need to find...

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.600
-Suleyman Shah has returned!
-Suleyman Shah is back!

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.500
Stop!

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.830
Stop! Stop!

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.360
Do not do anything
that is indecorum to Kayis.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.900
We shall talk about
the trial in the headquarters.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.500
The verdict shall be from our customs.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.930
Tie him up to the log.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.530
Let me go!

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.060
I will kill you all!

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.960
-Kill him!
-Don’t make him live!

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.960
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:27.400
Thank God, you are back safe and sound.
God has accepted my prayers.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.230
Suleyman. Suleyman.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.260
Suleyman.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.860
Dear God.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:00.930
