<font color="yellow">RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL</font>

1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,880
<font color="yellow">THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY</font>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:03,920
<font color="yellow">NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.</font>

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,640
<font color="yellow">Bey, dinner is ready. Come to the table.</font>

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,800
<font color="yellow">Dundar, come on, come to the table, son.</font>

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,200
<font color="yellow">I will come as soon as
I finish this, mother.</font>

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,160
<font color="yellow">Always be like that, my boy.
Finish the job at hand first.</font>

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,280
<font color="yellow">-Selcan?
-Yes, mother?</font>

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,600
<font color="yellow">-Bring the molasses, my girl.
-Yes, mother.</font>

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,800
<font color="yellow">Where is Gundogdu?</font>

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:49,920
<font color="yellow">He went to check the shepherds,
he will come in a few minutes.</font>

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:04,120
<font color="yellow">Put another plate on the table.
For Sungurtekin.</font>

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,320
<font color="yellow">If he comes back one day, he should know
that his place is ready at the table.</font>

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,080
<font color="yellow">Come on then. Why is Gundogdu late?</font>

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,720
<font color="yellow">He will come, mother.</font>

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:23,440
<font color="yellow">In the name of God.</font>

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,080
<font color="yellow">Well, son? You returned with a big hunt.</font>

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
<font color="yellow">Something like that, Bey.</font>

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
<font color="yellow">What kind of luck is this, brother?
You are like a lightning pulling tree.</font>

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,680
<font color="yellow">You attract all kinds of trouble
to yourself.</font>

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
<font color="yellow">The innocents were under attack.
We did what we could do.</font>

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
<font color="yellow">Who are they? Where do they come from?</font>

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,160
<font color="yellow">They were captured by the crusaders.
The man is a trader.</font>

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,000
<font color="yellow">The crusaders must be from
Antioch Countship.</font>

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:16,440
<font color="yellow">Knights don’t freely transport captives
in the Seljuk territory.</font>

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:25,240
<font color="yellow">Well?</font>

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:37,120
<font color="yellow">What I mean is, the Seljuks must
know about these prisoners.</font>

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
<font color="yellow">There were no Seljuk soldiers with them.</font>

28
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,360
<font color="yellow">Sooner or later, the kind of trouble
you called will be revealed, Ertugrul.</font>

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:03:01,760
<font color="yellow">What should have I done, brother?
Turn my back and leave?</font>

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,120
<font color="yellow">Both of you stop talking.
Host them in a way worthy of our tribe.</font>

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
<font color="yellow">We will see what the future holds.</font>

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,800
<font color="yellow">It is over, father. You are saved.
You will be healed.</font>

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
<font color="yellow">-Do we have permission?
-Come in, Bey.</font>

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,480
<font color="yellow">How is he?</font>

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,360
<font color="yellow">It is up to God from now on.</font>

36
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:34,320
<font color="yellow">With your permission.</font>

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,840
<font color="yellow">Come in, Aykiz.</font>

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,720
<font color="yellow">Aykiz.</font>

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,360
<font color="yellow">Turgut’s sweetheart.</font>

40
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask whether
you need anything or not.</font>

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:04:10,160
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

42
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,680
<font color="yellow">-We have been a big burden on you.
-Don’t say that.</font>

43
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,120
<font color="yellow">Bamsi Beyrek and Dogan are preparing their
tent for you, you can stay there tonight.</font>

44
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,200
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,160
<font color="yellow">...should stay with my father.</font>

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,440
<font color="yellow">Rest a bit tonight. You look very tired.</font>

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,680
<font color="yellow">Your father will need you more
when he wakes up tomorrow.</font>

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,720
<font color="yellow">Don’t worry, I will stay with your father.</font>

49
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,720
<font color="yellow">Bey, how did you let the boil get so big?</font>

50
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,000
<font color="yellow">We carry so many problems
on our backs, Hayme.</font>

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,600
<font color="yellow">Will we be afraid of one this small?</font>

52
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,480
<font color="yellow">If you had crushed its head when it was
small, it would have been long gone.</font>

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:00,360
<font color="yellow">The jackals used to live in the mountains,
now they are inside our tribe.</font>

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,360
<font color="yellow">They wait for my slightest
mistake to attack.</font>

55
00:05:04,360 --> 00:08:07,080
<font color="yellow">I hide it so that they don’t know
about my weakness.</font>

56
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,120
<font color="yellow">It is better to bite your lip
and sit with pain...</font>

57
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,480
<font color="yellow">...rather than giving them
something to talk about.</font>

58
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,480
<font color="yellow">At least, you should have told Akcakoca.</font>

59
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,440
<font color="yellow">I did, woman, I did.
He is preparing an ointment to cure me.</font>

60
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
<font color="yellow">We will put in on at night,
if God permits.</font>

61
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,040
<font color="yellow">What happened?
Are you thinking about our guests?</font>

62
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,560
<font color="yellow">I don’t know what kind of
a smoky candle this wick has lit.</font>

63
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:46,600
<font color="yellow">-Did you wear it?
-Yes.</font>

64
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
<font color="yellow">-How is it?
-It is beautiful, Aykiz.</font>

65
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,560
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

66
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,719
<font color="yellow">Dear God. You look like a queen
from a palace, Halime.</font>

67
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,119
<font color="yellow">You look so beautiful.</font>

68
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,879
<font color="yellow">What happened? Did I say something wrong?</font>

69
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,079
<font color="yellow">No. I just found it strange
for you to say that.</font>

70
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,040
<font color="yellow">Wait, let us put the head piece as well.</font>

71
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,000
<font color="yellow">Turgut Alp got this for me.</font>

72
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,680
<font color="yellow">Dear God! Why did you give it to me then?</font>

73
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,760
<font color="yellow">Because I knew that it would suit you.
Let me see?</font>

74
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:30,040
<font color="yellow">I was right.</font>

75
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,640
<font color="yellow">When is your wedding?</font>

76
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,000
<font color="yellow">After we migrate from this moorland,
if God permits.</font>

77
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,040
<font color="yellow">Isn’t it very hard to be
the wife of an Alp?</font>

78
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,880
<font color="yellow">If his heart is beating for me,
who cares how hard it is?</font>

79
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,000
<font color="yellow">The only thing I want is for him
to be back safe and sound.</font>

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,440
<font color="yellow">As long as there is no death.</font>

81
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:31,880
<font color="yellow">-Shall we braid your hair, if you want?
-Alright.</font>

82
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,480
<font color="yellow">Do you have a man in your life?</font>

83
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
<font color="yellow">After my mother died, the only thing
that was in my life was being a mother...</font>

84
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,400
<font color="yellow">...to my brother Yigit and
be a companion to my father.</font>

85
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,880
<font color="yellow">-Anyway, which man would want...
-Are you out of your mind?</font>

86
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,040
<font color="yellow">Men would fight, they would turn
the world upside down for you.</font>

87
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,000
<font color="yellow">When was the last time
you looked at yourself in a mirror?</font>

88
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,240
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

89
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
<font color="yellow">Isn't he the brother of
the infidel called Titus?</font>

90
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. Bisol.</font>

91
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:14,160
<font color="yellow">Send these bodies to the Templars.</font>

92
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,240
<font color="yellow">We will be dealing with Titus as well now.</font>

93
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,040
<font color="yellow">You! You! Come here!</font>

94
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,160
<font color="yellow">Load this one on a horse.</font>

95
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,640
<font color="yellow">-Which tribe does this seal belong to?
-Kayi tribe, sir.</font>

96
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:41,040
<font color="yellow">So they are Kayis.</font>

97
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,640
<font color="yellow">If they are with Suleyman Shah,
our job is very difficult.</font>

98
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,600
<font color="yellow">Could that shepherd head
resist the Seljuk?</font>

99
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,480
<font color="yellow">-May you have a good morning, Ertugrul.
-You too.</font>

100
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,560
<font color="yellow">I brought you some food.</font>

101
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,440
<font color="yellow">You did not need to bother, Gokce Baci.</font>

102
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:12,040
<font color="yellow">-How is our wounded guest?
-Fine. He should be up in a few days.</font>

103
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,440
<font color="yellow">If God permits. May God give him health
and hope he does not bring any trouble.</font>

104
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,840
<font color="yellow">I will be back in a while and
we can go to the weaving area.</font>

105
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:29,800
<font color="yellow">Alright, Aykiz.</font>

106
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,840
<font color="yellow">Is my father better, Ertugrul Bey?</font>

107
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:45,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, much better.</font>

108
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,280
<font color="yellow">You will see when you go in.</font>

109
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,680
<font color="yellow">His fever has gone down. We can take him
to your tent tonight, if God permits.</font>

110
00:12:50,680 --> 00:13:00,440
<font color="yellow">Did you see the girl?</font>

111
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,760
<font color="yellow">She already has Ertugrul
eating from her hands.</font>

112
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,440
<font color="yellow">You can only see him
in your dreams from now on.</font>

113
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,480
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

114
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:18,280
<font color="yellow">It has been years since
I slept so peacefully.</font>

115
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:25,880
<font color="yellow">In the forest you said Templars.</font>

116
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,520
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

117
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:54,720
<font color="yellow">Who are they?</font>

118
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,000
<font color="yellow">An order that fights for Jerusalem.</font>

119
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,720
<font color="yellow">They are very strong and ruthless.</font>

120
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,560
<font color="yellow">Their only aim is to take revenge
on Jerusalem.</font>

121
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,000
<font color="yellow">If they are so strong,
what did they want from you?</font>

122
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,560
<font color="yellow">-Is this the Seljuk territory?
-Yes.</font>

123
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,320
<font color="yellow">Do you have an issue
with the Seljuks, Halime?</font>

124
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,360
<font color="yellow">Not at all. What issue can
the great Seljuks have with us?</font>

125
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,960
<font color="yellow">Towel.</font>

126
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,400
<font color="yellow">-What is wrong with you, my girl?
-Nothing, father. I didn’t see it.</font>

127
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,800
<font color="yellow">But you can still say
what you want to say, right?</font>

128
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,360
<font color="yellow">A thing cannot become reality just because
you want it very much. I learned this.</font>

129
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,040
<font color="yellow">From whom?</font>

130
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:01,920
<font color="yellow">We were going to get married with Turgut
after the migration, we yearned for it.</font>

131
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,000
<font color="yellow">The winter is knocking at our door and
we still don’t know where we will go to.</font>

132
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,120
<font color="yellow">I understand.
You are as impatient as your late mother.</font>

133
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,400
<font color="yellow">Take a look around you. Can we survive
the winter on a mountain this high?</font>

134
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,760
<font color="yellow">Why do you think we have headquarters?
Why do all the neighboring Beys come to...</font>

135
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,560
<font color="yellow">...our Suleyman Shah’s marquee?</font>

136
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,920
<font color="yellow">We will sit, we will talk and
we will solve this matter, if God permits.</font>

137
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,800
<font color="yellow">Don’t you worry about it.
We should not be late.</font>

138
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,120
<font color="yellow">My dear sweet girl, Aykiz.</font>

139
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,560
<font color="yellow">They will be gathering for headquarters,
Kurdoglu. Nobody knows what to do.</font>

140
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,720
<font color="yellow">We will get over this, with God’s help.</font>

141
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,800
<font color="yellow">Kurdoglu, the mountain is silent,
the rivers don’t babble anymore...</font>

142
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:55,880
<font color="yellow">...we have no rain.
We are stranded in this moorland.</font>

143
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:03,000
<font color="yellow">If we don’t move quickly our herds
will perish, our babies will die.</font>

144
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,560
<font color="yellow">Well? What is on your minds?</font>

145
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,080
<font color="yellow">A horse neighs according to its owner,
Kurdoglu. Our warning is to you.</font>

146
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,360
<font color="yellow">Weigh in on the decisions.</font>

147
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,280
<font color="yellow">Suleyman Shah is weak.
He can’t even ride a horse now.</font>

148
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:26,120
<font color="yellow">In other words, Kurdoglu...</font>

149
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,160
<font color="yellow">...horse belongs to who rides it,
sword belongs to who gird it.</font>

150
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,360
<font color="yellow">Mother?</font>

151
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,760
<font color="yellow">I came to Akcakoca to get
some healing herbs.</font>

152
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:54,320
<font color="yellow">He is out. Tell me what you want,
I will bring them to you, mother.</font>

153
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,840
<font color="yellow">No, I will come and pick them up later.</font>

154
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,080
<font color="yellow">Our guest.</font>

155
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,840
<font color="yellow">Numan Bey’s daughter. Halime.</font>

156
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,120
<font color="yellow">Welcome to our tribe, my girl.
How is your father, did he recover?</font>

157
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:15,800
<font color="yellow">-Yes.
-I am glad. May God heal him.</font>

158
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,800
<font color="yellow">Our tents are always open for you.
If you have a problem, do not hesitate...</font>

159
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,400
<font color="yellow">...come and tell me immediately, alright?
-May God bless you, Hayme Hanim.</font>

160
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,120
<font color="yellow">Not on the ground, not in the air...</font>

161
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,520
<font color="yellow">...only in the hearts of
devoted believers...</font>

162
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,880
<font color="yellow">...the One that creates,
makes all creation one...</font>

163
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:54,320
<font color="yellow">...in the name of God,
most Merciful and most Graceful.</font>

164
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:11,960
<font color="yellow">Between the blue skies and dark ground,
let our blood, our clan, our tribe...</font>

165
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,120
<font color="yellow">...our homes, our sons, our daughters...</font>

166
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,720
<font color="yellow">...be united, be free, be keen.</font>

167
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,520
<font color="yellow">In the presence of our most just Bey,
may we bless our headquarters.</font>

168
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,160
<font color="yellow">-Amen.
-Amen.</font>

169
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,560
<font color="yellow">In the 99 names of our Great God,
Who creates with only saying “let be”...</font>

170
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,160
<font color="yellow">...Who fills our hearts with belief.
In the name of God.</font>

171
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

172
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,040
<font color="yellow">My beys, my warriors,
the leaders of my clans.</font>

173
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,160
<font color="yellow">Welcome and be blessed.</font>

174
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,760
<font color="yellow">-Thank you.
-Thank you.</font>

175
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,000
<font color="yellow">Thank God that before we set on the road
to sell our goods, a trader has come.</font>

176
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,320
<font color="yellow">I say that we sell our goods
to this trader at prime value...</font>

177
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,679
<font color="yellow">...and save from the travel expenses.</font>

178
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,560
<font color="yellow">That would be fine
if our only problem was the goods.</font>

179
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,760
<font color="yellow">We don’t have any pastures left
to graze our stock.</font>

180
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,160
<font color="yellow">They cannot drink water, cannot give milk.
They are all starving to death.</font>

181
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,480
<font color="yellow">We need to find a solution immediately.</font>

182
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
<font color="yellow">I also see the despair. We sent messengers
to all beys in the region.</font>

183
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,480
<font color="yellow">We asked for a territory
but famine is everywhere.</font>

184
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,840
<font color="yellow">Moreover, Turkmen tribes running away
from the Mongol invasion are everywhere.</font>

185
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,280
<font color="yellow">What shall we do, shall we draw our swords
against our brothers for a pasture?</font>

186
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,600
<font color="yellow">Is God’s merciful treasure is closed, Bey?
We have been camping here for months.</font>

187
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,719
<font color="yellow">We cannot find a solution.
When did Kayis became so desperate?</font>

188
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,600
<font color="yellow">-Isn’t there anywhere for us to go?
-If we cannot find a solution...</font>

189
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,439
<font color="yellow">...how can we sustain our tribe?</font>

190
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:47,279
<font color="yellow">Since when have we forgotten God,
the Bringer of Prosperity.</font>

191
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,439
<font color="yellow">Our souls are kneaded with patience.</font>

192
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:56,239
<font color="yellow">Whatever he blesses us with,
we should be happy.</font>

193
00:19:56,239 --> 00:20:00,639
<font color="yellow">We learned what patience is by traveling
without a home, Wild Demir.</font>

194
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,239
<font color="yellow">Our wish is that our descendants don’t
wonder about without a home as well...</font>

195
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:08,959
<font color="yellow">...don’t tell us what patience is.</font>

196
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:13,559
<font color="yellow">When did I ever leave you without clothes
or food, for you to worry so much?</font>

197
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,959
<font color="yellow">Never, Bey. I did not mean like that.</font>

198
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:29,039
<font color="yellow">Bey, you never let us go bare or hungry.
At the same time we never let you be...</font>

199
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:36,759
<font color="yellow">...without soldiers or weapons.</font>

200
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,319
<font color="yellow">Bey, we say that we should find
a new home and migrate from here.</font>

201
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:46,959
<font color="yellow">-To where?
-Anywhere where our sheep can live.</font>

202
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:53,559
<font color="yellow">Let us go back to our forefathers’ lands.
They say the Mongols are getting weaker.</font>

203
00:20:53,559 --> 00:21:00,519
<font color="yellow">Whoever says this is a liar! The Mongol
bandits are like hungry wolf packs.</font>

204
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,879
<font color="yellow">Didn’t anyone think of a solution, Bey?</font>

205
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:13,079
<font color="yellow">Aleppo.</font>

206
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,799
<font color="yellow">I heard that  Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz is
gathering an army against the crusaders.</font>

207
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,799
<font color="yellow">What do you have in mind, my nephew?</font>

208
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:27,159
<font color="yellow">I say that, we should send
an envoy to Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz.</font>

209
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,079
<font color="yellow">He should say, “you give us a home,
we shall give you soldiers with weapons.”</font>

210
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,879
<font color="yellow">This way we can fight with the crusaders
to become veterans and at the same time...</font>

211
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:36,719
<font color="yellow">...we could have a place we can call home.</font>

212
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:45,879
<font color="yellow">Aleppo.</font>

213
00:21:45,879 --> 00:22:37,559
<font color="yellow">We should act at once, Bey.</font>

214
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:46,479
<font color="yellow">Since when do we give a decision
before I say the last word?</font>

215
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:51,719
<font color="yellow">I am sorry, Bey.</font>

216
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:55,919
<font color="yellow">Do you accept Gundogdu’s suggestion, Agas?</font>

217
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:03,719
<font color="yellow">-We accept.
-Yes.</font>

218
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:10,959
<font color="yellow">I find it suitable as well.
May it be prosperous, if God permits.</font>

219
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">-If God permits.
-If God permits.</font>

220
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Who will go as the envoy, Bey?</font>

221
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Ertugrul!</font>

222
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Suleyman Shah, some tactless people in
your tribe has put a smear in our honor.</font>

223
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">The honor of the Sultan who gave a home
to my tribe is my honor, Karatoygar.</font>

Sultan Aladdin and his commander?</font>

225

<font color="yellow">-Did you forget the axe there?
-I did.</font>

227
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You ambushed an ambassador regiment
and slaughtered their knights.</font>

228
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">As if that was not enough,
you kidnapped the three prisoners...</font>

229
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...the regiment was taking to the Sultan.
Give back those prisoners.</font>

230
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet

our customs, Karatoygar!</font>

00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">We do not hand over guests
who have come to our tribe.</font>

233
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet

of the Seljuk Sultan.</font>

coming out of the Sultan’s mouth.</font>

Suleyman Shah.</font>

Karatoygar!</font>

the state but he would...</font>

238
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...put his forefather Oguz’s
customs first, then sit on his throne.</font>

239

<font color="yellow">You cannot have a sultan from a man
who doesn’t know customs and tradition.</font>

240

<font color="yellow">You cannot be a Bey or a man!</font>

241
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">And we would not have anything to do
with someone who is not a man!</font>

242
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You should know this as
a commander of the Great Seljuk.</font>

243
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet

244
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet

00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet

You have two days.</font>

we know how to come and get them.</font>

<font color="yellow">...as well as the next Bey
when the time comes.</font>

301
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">We need to get rid of this Karatoygar
from our backs.</font>

302
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">When my father says “customs”
he never backs down.</font>

303
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Ertugrul, look at the problems
you created for us.</font>

304
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">We need to convince my father. If we
convince him, Ertugrul would back down.</font>

305
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You talk like you don’t know your father.</font>

306
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">He would not give them even
if the sky fell down.</font>

307
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">What will we do then?</font>

308
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Your father told me that he will
send me to Karatoygar as an envoy.</font>

309
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I will do anything that is required.</font>

310
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Ertugrul Bey.</font>

311
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Do you have time?</font>

312
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">What happened? Is there a problem?</font>

313
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">No. This is something else.</font>

314
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I am listening.</font>

315
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I heard that Karatoygar came.
He wanted us.</font>

316
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">-Yes, he did.
-Don’t put your tribe in danger for us.</font>

317
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">We can take care of ourselves.</font>

318
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">My father is getting better.
We can leave within two days.</font>

319
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Even if all the world were against us,
we would not deliver you to those tyrants.</font>

320
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">If you get in a fight with Karatoygar,
there would be consequences.</font>

321
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Don’t worry.
We Kayis know how to handle all hardships.</font>

322
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">What’s up?</font>

323
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I cannot sleep, mother.</font>

324
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

325
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">What do you dwell on now?</font>

326
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I fell into a fire, mother.
I fell right in the middle of it.</font>

327
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I would not mind if I got burnt alone,
but I threw the whole tribe into fire.</font>

328
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">When you were at the point of falling,
did you know that it would come to this?</font>

329
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Whether you would be facing
those infidel bandits...</font>

330
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...or that said commander being allies
with the crusaders?</font>

331
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Could you have closed your eyes and
turned your back to the...</font>

332
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">-...cries of that gazelle eyed beauty?
-How could I, mother?</font>

333
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You could not. You would not, my son.
You could not.</font>

334
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You couldn’t have known that it would
come to this when you went hunting...</font>

335
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...that you would be throwing
the whole tribe into fire with yourself.</font>

336
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You threw us in.</font>

337
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Yes, you did.</font>

338
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">The fire can burn a dough
and turn it into ash...</font>

339
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...or it may cook the dough into bread.</font>

340
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">It was He who took you to
that place you fell.</font>

341
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You don’t have the right to protest
His decision, nor does the tribe.</font>

342
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">This is a test from the Great God.
In this test we can either turn to ash...</font>

343
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...or transform into bread. So don’t
listen to those whispers inside you...</font>

344
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...or to the presumptuous people
inside the tribe.</font>

345
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Become a soldier of our customs and stand
strong behind your father’s decisions.</font>

346
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">May God never take you or
my father away from leading us.</font>

347
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">May God protect you, my son.</font>

348
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Come on, take this water and
put it to your father’s side.</font>

349
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I brought you water, father.</font>

350
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Give me some.</font>

351
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I should have been there instead of you.</font>

352
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I will fight until the blood of
the ones who did this to you is dried up.</font>

353
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I will fight until the last one of
them is in a grave.</font>

354
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">You will be revenged, my brother.
I promise you.</font>

355
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">If God won’t be by my side on this path,
I will turn to devils.</font>

356
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I will bring hell upon the Turkmens.</font>

357
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I will be their wrath until the day I die.</font>

358
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">I promise you.</font>

359
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">Forgive me, father.</font>

360
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">That was it, Ilyas Fakih.
I didn’t know how to interpret this dream.</font>

361
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">But a lump of fire has been burning
inside me since last night.</font>

362
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">There are two options, Bey.</font>

363
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">First one is, hard times await us.</font>

364
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">The second is...</font>

365
00:23:10,959 --> Not Yet
<font color="yellow">...this may be a spiritual order on
who will be your successor.</font>
