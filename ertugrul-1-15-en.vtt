RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.900
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.300
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.560
Why is it dark in here?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.860
Rahman!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.130
Yes, Bey?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.460
Why are these oil lamps not lit, Rahman?

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.200
I don’t know, Bey.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.300
You would not be aware
even if doomsday had started.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.030
Bey?

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.060
-Find something and block that tear.
-Yes, Bey.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.600
No one will know about what happened here.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.930
Don’t ever leave my father alone.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.930
Yes, Bey.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.460
Thank God. The cramps were a good news.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.830
Road to motherhood is painful
but the end is a blessing.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.200
You made us happy in these hard times.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.560
May God permit us to hold
the child in our arms.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.260
If God permits, mother.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.060
If my Bey father recovers soon,
he would be happy too.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.830
Of course he would. We were yearning
for a grandchild for a long time.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.230
Of course he would be happy.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.460
-Sister.
-My Gokce.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.460
Gundogdu...

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.530
Son, we have good news.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500
Our bride Selcan is pregnant.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.030
He will continue our progeny and
become Bey of the tribe, if God permits.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.300
If God permits. Thank you, mother.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.930
-May you be blessed.
-Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.800
You should not have left
my Bey father alone.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.330
He is not alone, Hatun.
Rahman is with him.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.560
You take care and do not worry
about other things.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.030
What a bitch.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.160
First she sent me to the tent.
Then sent her husband after me.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.460
So she wanted Suleyman Shah dead in order
to take revenge for her father Alpsungur.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.400
And she was going to make me
a bait for Gundogdu at the same time.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.530
Two birds with one stone.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.600
I could not work out the bitch’s game.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.260
When a wolf gets old,
it becomes the laughingstock of the dogs.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.200
What do you say, Alpargu?
Are we too old now?

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.430
Their cries tear my heart apart. I wish
we could kill them before setting on fire.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.100
This illness is not like
the ones you know, son.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.160
If you touch the meat or blood of these
animals, the whole tribe would be doomed.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.830
Our Holy Mother,
give me a sign to bring a tinge of hope.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.960
If my father is alive
and if I can meet him...

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.200
...give me a sign.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.900
Your highness...

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.160
...are you here?

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.330
Amen.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.360
You told me that you were prepared
to learn the truth.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.460
Then come with me.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.130
-Is it here?
-Yes.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.900
You never saw me, your highness.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.300
Is my father behind this door?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.130
-Father?
-My daughter?

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.200
-Father!
-My girl!

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.230
Father!

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.530
-Father!
-My girl!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.360
Father,
I thought you were killed years ago.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.330
I always thought of you.
Hope of seeing you again kept me alive.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.800
Father, why are you here?

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.960
Your mother, your sister and
you are in my dreams every night.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.260
-Mother...
-What happened to your mother, my girl?

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.330
We lost her to plague last year.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.000
Father, why are they holding you here?

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.860
Uncle told us that you were dead.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.960
Does my uncle know that you are here?

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.360
I will talk with him and
take you out of here.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.900
My girl!

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.130
Father?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.360
My girl!

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.830
-Father.
-My daughter.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.900
My baby!

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.830
My baby! My Elanora!

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.260
My baby, my Elanora!

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.500
Help me God!

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.100
Help me God!

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.830
In short, Ertugrul Bey,
just like the poet says...

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.100
I burned and turned to ash
I became a guide for the sufferers

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.300
I was a Shah and became a subject
With the fire of your love

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.500
With your permission, Bey.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.860
It is your turn to take watch.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.500
I could not sleep.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.300
Halime.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.160
You know that...

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.830
...I have a thousand problems.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.930
Their solutions are in my power...

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.400
...and my power is in my belief.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.400
But there is one problem.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.460
It is the most beautiful problem...

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.830
...but it burns my heart.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.200
And its solution is only with you.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.200
That beautiful eyed gazelle swept away
my feet and made me join its path.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.000
It took me to you
and threw me to the sea of love.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.130
I was just about to kill it but...

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.960
...it burned my heart with a fire of love.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.960
What I am trying to say is...

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.400
...since the first moment I saw you...
-Please, Ertugrul. Stop.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.530
I shall not.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.100
I cannot send you away with my own hands.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.460
Do not go.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.830
Stay with me.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.800
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.800
...and my companion till the end.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.930
You are a valiant and honest brave
with a good heart, Ertugrul Bey.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.300
We owe you not one but a thousand lives.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.230
But my fate is sealed a long time ago.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.500
I cannot leave my father and brother
in a world of unknown to go after love.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.900
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.330
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.860
This is your tongue talking.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.300
What about your heart?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.560
What does your heart say, Halime?

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.330
My heart and my tongue talk the same.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.400
Don’t go.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.330
Halime!

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.300
Halime?

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.600
Halime!

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.460
Halime! Halime!

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.030
Halime!

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.860
-Halime!
-Halime!

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.460
Halime. Halime.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.100
Halime, my girl!

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.800
Hold down the rear! Let us separate.
We will meet in Aleppo!

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.860
We shall separate.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.130
Halime.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.030
-Sister?
-Come on, boy! Come on.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.160
-Sister!
-Come on!

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.530
-Sister.
-Come on, we are going.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.130
Go on. Quick! Quick!

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.600
Sir, they are running away.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.960
Ertugrul is trapped now...

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.000
...let us catch the small Shahzade
to please Ustad.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.260
Get the horses.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.960
You carry on, Shahzade.
I will catch up with you.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.930
Come on. Come on!

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.400
Bey, you catch up with them.
We will guard your back.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.900
Quick, to the horses!

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.060
That bitch called Selcan shall regret
the day she was born.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:40.500
She will pay for the trick
she played on me dearly.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.200
I shall breath down her neck like death.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.200
There is no end to tricks in Selcan.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.030
She walks in the tribe
like a ball of fire.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.860
She bellows the fire anywhere she likes.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.230
And if my name is Kurdoglu...

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.260
...I know how to turn that fire into ash.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.500
You shall take one life of
that double lived bitch.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.230
Before she can hold her baby
in her arms...

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.030
...before she can brag about giving
a grandchild to the Bey bloodline...

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.000
...that baby shall die.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.830
Get out of the way.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.200
My dear lamb...

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.800
...I brought you water, get up.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.230
Was it you...

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.460
...who killed my father Baybora?

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.230
Here you are, my girl.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.030
May it be easy on you.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.000
May it be easy on you, Baci.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.300
With God’s permission, we are ready,
Gundogdu Bey.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.360
What happened, Bey? Is there something
that clouds your heart, that worries you?

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.800
There are dangers everywhere, Wild Demir.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.530
I will allocate some trusted
Alps for your journey.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.560
You are son of a Bey, you are a Bey.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.530
You don’t need to tell me everything.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.330
But if there is something
I need to know...

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.860
...you would tell me, right, my Bey?

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.100
I always say that caution is a virtue.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.200
We cannot even trust the clouds on top
or the wind that blows.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.360
Anyway, you should start
your own preparations.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:26.160
Don’t talk like that, Bey.
What preparation a man like me can have?

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.600
I just need to say goodbye to someone,
while there is still time.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.300
I will handle that in the mean time.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.300
Yigit!

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.800
Yigit!

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.100
Was it you...

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.200
...who killed my father Baybora?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.800
Baybora was like a brother to me.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.960
Your father was killed by those who
see us as a threat to their Seigniory.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.860
What are you trying to say?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.400
You should understand, the killer of
your father is Suleyman Shah.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.330
Could those who we say Bey and Shah,
those who we crown, kill us, father?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.000
But if I am your son...

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.260
...I shall make them pay for it.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.530
Amen.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:39.460
I am going, my dear wife.
We are migrating again.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.900
The caravan is ready.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.400
But this time,
you will not be in the caravan.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.530
You will not see our new homeland.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:00.460
When we set up our camp, the first thing
we will do will be to wed Aykiz.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.960
That day...

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.830
...I shall cry quietly in a corner.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.990
As you are not beside me,
you won’t be able to wipe my tears.

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.960
Aykiz will give me a grandson
when the time comes.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.330
You won’t be able to hold
those little hands and feet.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:34.990
My battle worn and battered heart...

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:39.260
...will be even more worn out
being without you.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:47.490
But no one will need to say:
“Come on. Get up, Wild  Demir.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:54.130
Who will make weapons for
the Alps of this tribe other than you?”

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.860
Isn’t this world a temporary moorland
for everyone, my loved one?

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.860
When the time comes, I shall join
the caravan that goes to the real home.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.400
We will meet then.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.130
Knowing this is enough for me, my love.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:28.030
The woman I saw the first time I opened my
eyes, the woman I gave my heart and loved.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.460
Until then, while you are under
this cold ground...

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:41.430
...I shall be feeling cold even
in front of the ironsmith’s fire.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.400
I wanted you to know that.
May God bless you.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.260
My sincere condolences, son.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.400
The world is like that.
An inn with two doors.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.600
Thank you,  Master Demir. The world is
the innkeeper, we are the travelers.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.860
Those who finish the number of breaths
given to them go under the ground.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:17.560
You are right, Bozok.
May God give you more patience.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.100
Anyway, see you in the camp.
Peace be upon you.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.400
Peace be upon you, Master Demir.
May you have a good journey.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.830
-Yigit!
-Don’t move!

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.500
Drop down the axe. I would cut his throat!

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.000
Tie him up.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.960
Halt!

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.430
We need go faster, Shahzade.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.430
She loses more blood
as the horse goes faster, Ertugrul.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.200
We shall rest here.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.600
Ertugrul and the rest...

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.430
...you caught them...

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.160
...right?

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.230
Sir, Ertugrul and others...

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.860
Did you let them escape?

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.200
Sir, spare us.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.060
Gokce, put these ointments
in a place we can find easily.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.460
-We cannot waste time during the journey.
-Alright, mother.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.000
Selcan, don’t lift heavy things.
God forbid, you have pains as it is.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.800
Do you know what I think?

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.930
It is not wise for you stay back with
the caravan while you are pregnant.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.030
Come with us in this journey.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.430
Thank you, mother.
I do not know what Gundogdu would say.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.500
I do not think that he would oppose but...

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.030
...you are right, he is your Bey,
you should ask him.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.360
You take the arms rack.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.330
Gundogdu...

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.800
...Mother Hayme says...

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:24.230
...I do not want to worry,
you should come with us as well.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.530
She is worried after last night.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.560
How come?
What happened last night for her to worry?

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.200
Because of my cramps. She is afraid that
I would get tired in the caravan...

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.600
...and something might happen to the baby.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.300
You are staying here as well.
After last night, I would get worried too.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.530
I want you to be in front of
my eyes all the time.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:00.960
So you worry for my son.
You want to be beside him.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.260
As you wish, Gundogdu.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560
