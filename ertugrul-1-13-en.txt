ALEPPO
You wait around here.
I will be back shortly.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
I am looking for a book.
“Mawaqi alNujum.”
The Twilight of the Stars.
Do you have it?
Of course.
What do you expect to learn
from that book?
I am after what everyone else
is seeking to learn.
I want to look in the sky and
foresee the things of tomorrow.
Maybe the author did not write
the book with that intention.
I want to buy this. How much is it?
Accept it as a gift.
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious and Most Merciful.
Then I swear by the setting of the stars.
And indeed, it is an oath.
It is of course a valuable Book.
None touch it except the purified.
God always states the truth.
They say that...
...after the sun rises, you cannot
look at the stars to find direction.
Do not dwell on the stars.
If you want to see...
...the Sun is in my hand.
None touch it except the purified.
That is the Quran.
But It does not state
what will happen tomorrow.
For the eyes that can see...
...the secrets are Here,
as well as the secret of the secrets.
The book you took just now is only
a drop from the Ocean called Quran.
I never saw you before in Aleppo,
stranger. Are you from nearby?
I am a poor traveler.
I set off from the countries where
the sun sets to look for the country...
...where the sun will rise from.
I am the writer of the book
which was given as a present to you.
What happened, sir?
The man was Ibn Arabi.
We should not be late.
People are waiting for us at the lodge.
We will go by the stream,
you take the hills.
Great God.
Turgut, you carry on.
Carry on.
Shahzade, carry on.
You tactless people!
What is the meaning of this?
How can you shoot
an arrow at Ertugrul Bey?
We do not know, Dogan.
Kurdoglu Bey gave a direct order.
Surrender without a fight.
And the arrow was just a warning...
...otherwise I could have hit him
right on the neck.
Your tongue has overgrown! I will cut it
for you to take it back to Kurdoglu.
Go back to our tribe.
I do not want to spill your blood.
We don’t want to spill
the blood of our brothers as well.
If you obey us and return to the tribe,
our brotherhood would continue.
I shall not obey you or Kurdoglu.
I only obey my forefather’s customs.
Even if Kurdoglu sends a thousand man
here, I would not give up those...
...who took refuge nor
I would spill a brother’s blood.
Ertugrul Bey, I hope you did not face
another trouble because of us.
I prefer to be sleepless
instead of seeing a nightmare.
We put you in a bad situation but
we set off early as a precaution.
You are right as well.
If a lion goes hunting,
it gets blamed for spilling blood...
...if it lays down,
it gets blamed for being lazy.
Ertugrul Bey, when we left the tent,
Gundogdu Bey was in the tent alone.
Would he face a problem?
Do not worry.
My brother can overcome all difficulties.
Those four have died.
There is only one way for you to be saved.
If you tell me where
Ertugrul Bey is going, you will be free.
Aleppo. They are going to Aleppo.
This much freedom is enough.
Go to the castle, take the knights.
We shall set a trap for them
on the Aleppo road.
So he is taking the Shahzades to Aleppo.
Sister, what are you saying?
Sister, this thing is over.
Ertugrul will never come back.
How can he not come back.
His tribe, his father is here, Gokce.
Do not burn down your heart yet.
But, sister...
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.
May you have a good morning, my girl.
Is Gundogdu inside?
He did not sleep all night.
He must be asleep.
May you have a good morning, Gundogdu Bey.
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.
What is the matter?
Not good news.
Come on.
Wash your face, then we have to talk.
Let us talk.
Your young brother Dundar...
...came to me early in the morning.
He wanted to say something
to Ertugrul but he did not listen.
You did not listen to him either.
He face was all white from fright
when I saw him.
What happened? Why was he frightened?
Not good news.
They found Baybora’s dead body with Yigit
at the Karadere stream.
Baybora’s body?
Yes.
Who would kill him and why?
I don’t know. But my mad mind
races on and thinks that...
...they have lost control,
thinking the tribe’s Bey is gone.
The only thing they did not have was
blood on their hands.
Do not think like that,
would this tribe ever be without a Bey?
Don’t worry. At the headquarters, they'll
learn that the Bey of the tribe is alive.
Don’t you worry.
Bey, in order to get ahead of Ertugrul
we went up the trail at Kiziltepe.
When our team did not arrive,
we got suspicious and went back.
When we came here, they were all dead.
Alpargu, bury them all
before anyone sees them.
Whatever happens, don’t forget that
you have swore obedience to Kurdoglu Bey.
He is Suleyman Shah’s acting Bey.
Then why are we coming here, Alpargu?
What business do we have
at the headquarters called by Gundogdu?
We came to give a lesson
to our Bey’s incompetent son.
You support our Bey whatever happens,
that would be sufficient.
Kurdoglu Bey...
...Baybora’s place has been empty
for such a long time.
We cannot see him in the headquarters.
What happened?
Where is he?
I will say it before you.
Last night he was found...
...at the banks of Karadere stream,
stabbed to death.
On the night of the day Ertugrul
came to you and inquired where he is.
What do you insinuate, Gundogdu?
Talk openly.
Be quiet, Alpargu. Keep your mouth shut.
Your master will keep quiet as well...
...I shall be talking now.
You created factions within the tribe.
You caused discord.
You made people stone our guests’ tent.
Tell me Kurdoglu...
...is attacking guests customary?
Come to the point, Gundogdu.
Are you trying to accuse the person
you called Emmi until yesterday?
Aren’t you burying Suleyman Shah
even before he dies and...
...go out to collect obedience
from tribe’s Beys?
In our customs, questioning belongs to
the headquarters and answering to the Bey.
God help us.
We are not going to learn
our customs from the children.
We know what headquarter members
may ask and how to answer them.
You want to be Bey
and call us to account...
...but you could not even steer
the caravan that was entrusted in you.
You call me to account
for the death of Baybora...
...but do you know what Ertugrul did?
Listen to me well, Beys of Kayi.
Ertugrul...
...killed five warriors of our tribe.
That is a lie!
This is slander.
Mother Hayme, Ertugrul would
never do such a thing.
This shameless person
has lost control, my girl.
The slanders are only
a reflection of his own dark heart.
And thus...
...Gundogdu who caused our Alps
to die in the caravan ambush...
...and Ertugrul who slayed our Alps
cannot challenge me at all!
Decency, Kurdoglu, decency!
Enough!
Aren’t you ashamed of
slandering our Bey’s sons?
Don’t you have shame?
Calm. Be calm, Wild Demir.
There is no lie in my words.
God is my witness.
Ertugrul kidnapped Suleyman Shah’s
guests last night.
Their fate is unknown. In order to learn
what happened to our Bey’s guests...
...I sent some of my Alps after them.
In the morning,
news of their death reached me.
You are so anxious to stir up trouble
inside the tribe, Kurdoglu.
Aren’t you ashamed to take advantage
of my father’s illness?
Gundogdu do not talk like you don’t know.
You set this up with your brother.
You disobeyed the order and gave the
agreement given to you, to Ertugrul.
One of us has to stay in the tribe
and fight against Kurdoglu’s doings.
Kurdoglu?
He learned that Numan and his son are
Shahzades. Now he is trying to convince...
...the Beys in the headquarters to migrate
somewhere in Seljuk territory, not Aleppo.
You are the one who is trying to take
advantage of your father’s illness.
You are the one who sits in his place,
while he is laying in his bed.
Thank God that my blood brother’s eyes
are closed and he doesn’t see these days.
Let us go, Beys of Kayi.
A headquarters not called by
Suleyman Shah...
...is not a place we want to be in.
What will happen now, Bey?
The order given by Suleyman Shah
is still valid.
Preparations for migration
to Aleppo shall continue.
We will not give up on our Bey’s words
or his guests. With the help of God.
We are almost out of the Seljuk territory,
we can rest our horses here for a while.
How is he, mother?
The same, my son.
Did you hear our voices?
I am going to say that we should
send your father as soon as possible.
You are right, mother. We should have him
reach our destination...
...before he gets really distraught
during the migration.
You are right, Gundogdu Bey.
I can check and fix the old cart...
...for a more comfortable journey
for Suleyman Shah.
Thank you, Usta.
If he goes to Aleppo sooner,
we might find a remedy as well.
But I cannot come with you. You know that
the tribe is like a witch’s cauldron.
Don’t worry, Gundogdu Bey. I can take
Mother Hayme and Suleyman Shah...
...to Aleppo safe and sound.
We will leave early in the morning.
If God permits.
Look at Ertugrul.
I would have never thought that
he would kill the tribe’s warriors.
You have been my assistant for nothing
all these years, Alpargu.
Bey...
...this is a Crusader arrow.
Bravo, Alpargu.
You start to understand slowly.
Turgut Agabey?
Yes, brave boy?
How are you related to
Bamsi and Dogan Agabeys?
They are my blood brothers.
I have a blood brother as well now.
Who is your blood brother?
Dundar.
But you blood brothers
are always together...
...Dundar and I are separated.
The world is not so large, my friend.
Mountains may not meet...
...but people can meet again.
The hillside is quiet. There is no one
in sight. How was your side?
The downside is clear as well.
This is a secure place.
Everywhere is clear, why are you frowning.
Because you couldn’t find an enemy?
No, this man called Afsin
is making me anxious.
Do you know who he is?
I don’t know either
but it is not very important.
Don’t tire your pea sized brain out
with things like this.
Your mind is not used to thinking.
Look now, we are in the field
beside the water, right?
Shall we wrestle so that
I can crush you to the ground?
Alright. Alright but...
...do not cry when you lose!
Let me go! I said let me go!
Let me go!
What about you and Aykiz Abla?
She is my sweetheart.
Are Ertugrul Agabey and
my sister Halime sweethearts too?
Yigit Alp?
What are you saying?
Get the dried meat from the saddlebag.
But, sister.
Go on.
But sister...
Go on.
I will send Ertugrul to you, my brother.
Your soul will not be tormented anymore.
Are you fine, Shahzade?
Yes, thank you.
I am listening to my inner voice.
What does your inner voice say to you?
I think about my forefather Oguz.
He saw a dream, our Oguz Khan...
...and he pulled his golden bow
from sunrise to sunset...
...and said
this world is too small for two rulers...
...enough for one ruler.
And our Great Bilge Khan said...
...as long as the blue sky
does not fall down...
...or as long as the great earth
does not split apart...
...no one can overrule your customs.
Then my grandfather Tugrul Bey...
...after the Dandanaqan Battle...
...called for the Great Council...
...and opened up
new horizons for our people.
And opened the road to
Rome territory for us.
And in the Rome territory, in Manzikert...
...Sultan Alparslan...
wore his shroud for a new world order
and turned these lands...
...into a state.
Do you know what my inner voice says,
Ertugrul?
We need an another hero who will unite...
...lead and set a new vision
for these people.
