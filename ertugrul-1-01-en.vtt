RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.800
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.600
1225 - KAYI TRIBE

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.800
-Great God!
-Only one God!

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.300
-Great God!
-Only one God!

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.260
-Great God!
-Only one God!

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.560
-Great God!
-Only one God!

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.660
Even the iron could not stand
reciting of God and gave in.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.130
Wait a bit!

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.600
Take a look at this one.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.700
This is magnificent. I pity the enemy whom
this will be the Azrael of.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.760
In the hands of a valiant like you...

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.760
...let it be the sound of the oppressed,
wrath to the tyrants, if God permits.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.600
There’s no sword other than Zulfiqar and
no valiant other than His Holiness Ali.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.000
I’m ready to sacrifice myself for God,
who gave you to us.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.530
For the love of God, in the name of my
forefather Oguz, I’ll gird it with honor.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.100
Bring your hands.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.760
What is the matter?
Your tumblers are restless again.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.260
We are going hunting.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.200
They are getting ready.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.100
Are there any animals left to hunt
in this famine?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.630
You are right but...

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.730
...hunting keeps the Alps fit.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.560
It is better if we find a way to keep
the tribe alive as well.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.230
That can only be decided
on the headquarters tomorrow.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.230
If we don’t migrate from this highland
before winter, we would be doomed.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.200
But if you say that you know a solution,
tell us as well.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.760
My brother Gundogdu knows
these matters better than me.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.400
If you wish, talk to him.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.730
With Gundogdu?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.130
No, he never breaths a single word about.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.300
Is this what you bought for 40 coins?

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.500
This is called a map.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.230
What is it used for?

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.330
Look, we are here.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.800
Right at where these mountains are.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.560
This is Aleppo. This is Baghdad.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.260
And this is Damascus.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.100
And this is Konya,
where the Sultan’s palace is.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.130
Let go of the palaces
of the sultans and khans and...

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.130
...tell us where the tribe should
migrate to, Gundogdu.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.230
The elders are having a dumb moment.
Your father is quiet.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.760
He just sits in his tent like
a worrier not a warrior.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.560
Where is this place?

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.330
Everyone will learn tomorrow
at headquarters.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.500
You found a place, right?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.600
Please tell me, where is it?

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.230
Ertugrul!

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.330
Ertugrul!

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.360
Where are you going?

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.330
I am going hunting, brother.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.360
This is not the time to go hunting.
We have headquarters tomorrow.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.030
The headquarter is yours
and hunt is mine, brother.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.160
Alright. But don’t go too far.
Go quickly, come back quickly.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.200
What are you doing with that meat?
We are going hunting, did you forget?

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.200
We won’t let you starve during a hunt,
don’t you worry.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.800
How can you call a valiant as valiant if
he starves while he is hunting, Turgut?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.560
-This is just for the road.
-It is impossible to relieve your hunger.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.060
Come on, Alps.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.130
Your man is going.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.360
AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.030
Guard duty is your pride!

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.230
Guard duty is your honor!

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.600
If you betray your pride and honor...

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.400
...your death will not come
from the enemy, but from me!

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.230
You have honored us, Ustad-i Azam.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.260
That honor belongs to us.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.360
-Elanora.
-Commander Titus.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.630
I hope your journey was fine.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.530
Is everything alright, Titus?

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.060
We are safer than ever, sir.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.760
Your chambers are ready, sir.
Would you like to rest before lunch?

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.230
Elanora may rest. We have work to do.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.760
-As you wish.
-With your permission.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.560
What is the latest development
about the prisoners?

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.100
I gave that duty to my brother Bisol.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.730
They will submit Numan and his family
to Karatoygar.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.130
For the others, I waited for you.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.600
Good.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.400
Where are they taking us, father?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.430
To our palace, son.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.500
We will be free there, right?

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.800
Until eternity, son.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.660
Until eternity.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.500
So out fate was to return to Konya
like this.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.230
To the palace we were born in and
grew up, to be killed by our uncle.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.030
I will not let anything to happen
to you or your brother, my daughter.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.160
This way Karatoygar will be
dependent on us more than ever.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.000
It is very important for him to win
the favor of Sultan Aladdin.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.700
Karatoygar becoming a high officer
in the Seljuk court will relieve us.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.430
KARATOYGAR INN

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.630
-We did everything as you ordered, sir.
-Okay!

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.400
Head of guard!

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.000
Are the Turkmen tribes paying
their taxes?

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.360
We can’t control them, sir.
They are always on the move.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.360
-Which one is the biggest tribe?
-Kayi tribe, sir.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.760
They ran away from the Mongol invasion.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.130
-Who is their leader?
-Suleyman Shah.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.760
-How many tents?
-2000 tents. But they are well respected.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.360
-Do they pay their taxes?
-They do, sir.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.630
Good.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.560
Then, they shall pay their taxes
earlier this year.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.430
-But, sir...
-You heard what I said.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.060
How will this state remain standing?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.700
Inform all the tribes
in the region immediately.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.100
Yes, sir.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.460
Where are those templars?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.030
Halt!

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.230
Let us rest a bit here.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.160
Check the surroundings.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.500
We need to weaken the Seljuks
before the crusade.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.330
You should put more men
in the Seljuk court, Titus.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.430
Please be rest assured that
we will possess the whole court.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.600
There is a group in the Papacy,
who are reluctant about the crusade.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.160
I am not surprised.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.360
We need to make a plan that will mobilize
the whole Europe.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.200
We need to do this.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.600
The Christian world should unite
and act for Jerusalem.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.330
For this, we need to provoke
the Muslims and make them attack us.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.660
I have some very valuable prisoners.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.400
We can start with them.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.200
Calm down, son.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.460
Yigit.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.200
Commoner...

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.160
...you can go to hell.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.000
-Take us to our destination quickly.
-So you are very keen to die.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.730
I pity for your beautiful daughter
and your small Shahzade.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.560
Don’t shed a tear for us.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.000
If you had accepted to be allies with us,
you were to become the Seljuk sultan...

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.730
...and everything was going to be fine.
-You offered slavery for the Pope.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.130
We offered you peace...

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.560
...and a new world order.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.200
We wanted to live side by side.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.530
But...

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.330
...the Muslim blood will always be shed.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.630
There is no escape from this.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:49.160
And we will shed your blood with
the Muslim allies we have.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.300
You will not succeed.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.360
We will see.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.430
In the mean time...

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.800
...to all your men I had sent to hell...

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.360
...give them my regards.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.630
-The area is safe, sir.
-Good.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.530
Water the horses.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.100
These too.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.400
-Come on!
-Yeah!

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.130
Come on!

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.430
You two, go and sit somewhere else.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.700
I brought you water. Take it.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.060
Take it.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.800
Come on.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.160
They are not aware.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.760
Key! Take the key.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.760
Come on, my girl.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.200
We are in luck.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.000
The prisoners are running away!

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.160
-Quick, run!
-Get them!

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.260
-Father!
-Father!

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.730
-Are you alright?
-Father!

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.330
Quick, take your brother
and get out of here.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.630
No!

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.200
-Father!
-Father!

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.560
-Quick! Run away!
-No, we cannot leave you in this state.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.300
Take your brother and
get the hell out of here!

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.400
Come on, father! Get up! Come on!

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.600
So you tried to run away!
You will pay for this.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360
Father!

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.100
Father!

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.530
Have some decency! Dear God!
Have some decency!

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.200
Great God!

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.760
-Father!
-Father!

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.430
Father, stay with us, please!

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.460
Your first victim was a crusader.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.800
-Stay with us.
-Be strong, father.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.160
-Quick, bring some oak leaves.
-Okay.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.300
If we are successful, all the borders
in the region will change.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.730
We should not refrain from using
our order’s wealth to save Jerusalem.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.360
We are ready to spend the whole treasury.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:39.160
For young men, a new Jerusalem campaign
would be the shortest road to riches.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.130
They will be enlisting by the thousands
to be a member of the crusade army.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.100
The Catalans, the Venetians,
the Marseilleans...

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.160
...they will be pining for this carnival.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.100
Well...

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.260
...what about the spoilt princes of
Europe, how will we trust them?

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.060
When the Muslims start to fight
with each other...

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.630
...our job will not be difficult, Titus.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.600
What about the Seljuks, sir?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.600
Anatolia.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.700
They are on the peak of their power
with Sultan Aladdin.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.200
When we make the Turks and the grandsons
of Saladin Ayyubi fall out on...

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:30.400
...each other we will reach our goal.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.460
Jerusalem will be ours.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.700
Father, please be strong.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.000
We have to go immediately.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.260
You can go.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.760
We can look after ourselves.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.700
It will get dark soon.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.230
The jackals would have
already smelled the blood.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.800
-We should go.
-Dogan, bring the horses.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.160
It is easy to fend off a crusader brigade.
What about this?

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.600
Ertugrul is lost now.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.560
-God always helps those who get lost.
-He is lost real bad now.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.060
Come on.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.800
-What can you do alone as a woman?
-I said we won’t go.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.760
We owe you a life.
We will pay our debt one day.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.030
Tell us your name.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.000
Ertugrul from Kayi tribe.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.160
As you wish.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.300
May God be with you. I wish you good luck.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.260
We should go with them.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.530
Is your tribe far?

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.560
Even our money for bad days is finished,
Brother Afsin.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:17.130
We can set shop here. If we see that
they are not interested, we can go on.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.700
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you. Welcome.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.700
Welcome, Gazanfar Aga.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.060
You bring joy to Kayi tribe.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.300
Kurdoglu, my brother. You always
look very healthy, thanks to God.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:55.230
Would these moorlands keep a man healthy,
for us to be healthy, Gazanfer?

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.730
No, don’t say that. You look very well.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.330
Where is your caravan?

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.660
The caravan is near the black rock.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.130
I came to get permission from Suleyman
Shah to set up a stall in the market.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.730
How is business?

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.630
We thank God on what he gives.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.530
I wanted to come to Kayi to supply
whatever they need before the journey.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.100
Thank you, Gazanfer. I hope you meet
your expectations, if God permits.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.300
Thank you.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.560
If Suleyman Shah is available,
I would like to meet him.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.300
Tell our Bey that Gazanfer Aga is here.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.760
-How much is this?
-He is a mute, sir. Let me help you.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.600
80 coins.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.460
You look familiar to me.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.100
This is my first time in your tribe, sir.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.400
You probably took me for someone else.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.000
Peace be upon you, Suleyman Shah.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.630
And peace be upon you, trader. Welcome.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.530
You bring joy to us. Come and sit.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:39.030
Suleyman Bey, my eyes are so happy that
they had the chance to see you again.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.130
Please accept my presents. I brought them
from Constantinople for you.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.130
You did not have to bother.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.560
-Kurdoglu, give these to those in need.
-As you wish, Bey.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.560
Well?

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.730
Tell us now. What did those eyes see in
other parts of the world?

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.100
I wish I was deaf and not hear it.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.700
I wish I was blind and not see it, Bey.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.330
What happened?

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.430
Sultan Aladdin controlled Konya but...

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.700
...he worries that the fugitive Shahzades
may give him trouble.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.130
The Latins ransacked Constantinople.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.160
All Orthodox people left the city.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.060
There is no order, no peace...

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.160
...and with the famine now,
everyone is desperate.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.130
We heard that the leftovers from
the crusaders were getting restless.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.460
It is obvious that they are up to
something once again.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.000
Well...

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.160
...how are the common people?

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.600
They will be on the road again
to find something to eat.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:44.200
The rumor is that the Pope is calling for
a new crusade to the European princes.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.800
And we Muslims fight against each other.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.200
Sowing discord between us,
fueling the disorder as much as possible.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.460
From Anatolia to Basra,
everywhere is on fire.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.560
This fire will hit us as well, Bey.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.030
Please don’t say fire, it upsets me, Bey.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.600
I came to seek for permission to sell
my goods in your tribe.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.690
-You have our permission.
-Thank you.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.000
Karatoygar has come to the region
to control the Turkmen tribes.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.500
So difficult times await us.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.160
And this girl is from Venetia.
Rosalina, she has noble blood.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.030
A white skin, green eyes.
A rare find, commander.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.560
And she is very cheap as well.
I am in urgent need of money.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.560
This is a very good opportunity
for you and me.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.160
What do you say to this, commander?

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.430
They kidnapped her from
the Greek Islands.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.330
She screams beauty and freshness.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.000
She is a wild one.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.000
I personally trained her.
For a master with good taste.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.030
What about that blond one?

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.300
I must say that you have good taste.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.330
I bought her from the crusader discards.
They brought her in with a ship.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.000
She is Serbian,
she knows how to treat a man.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.160
Enough.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.100
Come here.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.600
You don’t need to be afraid of me.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.200
I am your master now.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.660
You chose the most expensive one,
commander. But she is worth it.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.260
-Sir?
-What happened?

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.700
The crusaders. They were ambushed.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.030
Didn’t you save them?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.560
We were too late.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.600
So you were late.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:02.060
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.130
-Come on, help them.
-Help them.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.160
Akcakoca, we have a wounded man.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.100
-Come on.
-Bamsi, take him in.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.300
-What happened?
-Nothing to worry about.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.560
-You are alright, yes?
-We all are, thank God.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.800
Ertugrul...

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.800
...what happened, my brother?

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.400
They were attacked, brother.
I will tell you later.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.460
-Look after them, Ramazan.
-As you wish, Bey.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.360
Who are they, Gundogdu?

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.260
I don’t know. He will tell us later.
We will find out soon.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.500
Sister, what is happening? Who are they?

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.100
We will find out soon. We will see.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.560
The sword hit him right below the rib.
Fortunately the oak leaves stopped...

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.630
...the bleeding,
otherwise we would have lost him.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.100
-Midwife, bring hot water.
-At once, Akcakoca.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.330
The leg is bad as well.
But we should fix this wound first.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.660
Akcakoca can take it from here.
Let us wait at the side.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.530
-We cannot leave our father alone, sister.
-Don’t worry.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.600
Your father is in good hands.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.460
Thank you very much. You are God sent.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.060
-We brought trouble to you.
-Don’t say that.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.260
You had more breaths to take,
more bites to eat.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.360
Where were the crusaders taking you?

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.760
I don’t know. They didn’t say.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:03.130
I guess they were going to sell us in
the slave market. My father is a trader.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.360
We were captured in the Mediterranean.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.700
Your father must be a good trader.
Having so many crusaders taking you.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.760
Yes.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:22.500
We were rich.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.060
But we don’t have anything left now.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.330
Well...

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.330
...which tribe is this?

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.500
You are in Kayi tribe.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.360
I am the son of
the tribe Bey, Suleyman Shah.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.360
We owe you three lives.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.200
-Do you want to be freed from slavery?
-Yes.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.330
-Then, kill this man.
-No!

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.100
I will buy and then free you.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:00.430
Commander, you are furious.
First calm down...

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.700
Shut your mouth.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.000
Don’t let me kill you as well.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.000
Sir, please spare me for my children.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.700
You are good for nothing.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.060
Do it!

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.700
-I can’t.
-I said do it!

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.360
I’m freeing you!

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:21.130
A slave that can kill someone
to be free...

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.600
...can kill her master one day as well.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.160
Get ready, we are going!

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.360
