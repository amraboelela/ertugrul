WEBVTT

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.800
-Ever-Living God!
-Righteous God!

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.660
Even the iron could not stand
reciting of God and gave in.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.130
Wait a bit!

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.600
Take a look at this one.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.180
Magnificent! I pity the enemy
whose final breath will be taken by this sword.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.760
In the hands of a valiant like you...

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.760
...let it be the sound of the oppressed,

03:06.880 --> 03:06.880
wrath to the tyrants, if God permits.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.600
There’s no sword other than Zulfiqar 

03:14.680 --> 03:14.680
and no valiant other than His Holiness Ali.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.000
I’m ready to sacrifice myself for God, who gave you to us.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.530
For the love of God

03:30.240 --> 03:30.240
in the name of my forefather Oguz, I’ll gird it with honor.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.100
Reach me your hands.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.760
What is the matter?

03:54.120 --> 03:54.120
Your tumblers are restless again.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.260
We are going hunting.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.200
They are getting ready.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.100
Are there any animals left to hunt in this famine?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.630
You are right but...

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.730
...hunting keeps the Alps fit.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.560
It is better if we find a way to keep
the tribe alive as well.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.230
That can only be decided at the headquarters tomorrow.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.230
If we don’t migrate from this highland
before winter, we would be doomed.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.200
But if you say that you know a solution

04:30.840 --> 04:30.840
tell us as well.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.760
My brother Gundogdu knows these matters better than me.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.400
If you wish, talk to him.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.730
No way!

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.130
No, he never breathes a single word about.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.300
Is this what you bought for 40 coins?

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.500
This is called a map.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.230
What is it used for?

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.330
Look

05:04.000 --> 05:04.000
we are here.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.800
Right at where these mountains are.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.560
This is Aleppo. 

05:10.720 --> 05:10.720
This is Baghdad.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.260
And this is Damascus.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.100
And this is 

05:16.040 --> 05:16.040
Konya, where the Sultan’s palace is.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.130
Let go of the palaces
of the sultans and khans and...

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.130
...tell us where the tribe should
migrate to, Gundogdu.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.230
The elders are having a blonde moment.

05:27.960 --> 05:27.960
Your father is quiet.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.760
He is sitting in his tent
just like a groomed owl.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.560
Where is this place?

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.330
Everyone will learn tomorrow at headquarters.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.500
You found a place, right?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.600
Please tell me, where is it?

05:49.920 --> 05:49.920
Ha?

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.230
Ertugrul!

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.330
Ertugrul!

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.360
Where are you going?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.330
I am going hunting, brother.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.360
This is not the time to go hunting. We have headquarters tomorrow.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.030
Let the headquarter be yours, and the hunt mine brother.

06:21.480 --> 06:21.480
Ok

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.160
Alright. But don’t go too far. Go quickly, come back quickly.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.200
What are you doing with that dried beef?

06:45.000 --> 06:45.000
We are going hunting, did you forget?

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.200
We won’t let you starve during a hunt, don’t you worry.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.800
How can you call a valiant as valiant if
he starves while he is hunting, Turgut?

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.560
This is just for the road.

06:54.720 --> 06:54.720
It is impossible to relieve your hunger.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.060
Come on, Alps.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.130
Your man is going.

07:13.640 --> 07:13.640
Ya Allah!
 
07:18.920 --> 07:18.920
Ya Allah!

07:20.800 --> 07:20.800
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha!
 
07:23.920 --> 07:23.920
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha!
 
07:31.800 --> 07:31.800
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha!

08:14.040 --> 08:14.040
Ah!

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.030
Guard duty 

08:48.880 --> 08:48.880
is your pride!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.230
Guard duty is your honor!

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.600
If you betray your pride and honor

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.400
your death will not come from the enemy

09:01.320 --> 09:01.320
but from me!

09:04.520 --> 09:04.520
Ya! Ya!

09:09.160 --> 09:09.160
Ya!

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.230
You have honored us, Ustad-i Azam.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.260
That honor belongs to us.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.360
Elanora.

10:04.680 --> 10:04.680
Commander Titus.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.630
I hope your journey was fine.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.530
Is everything alright, Titus?

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.060
We are safer than ever, sir.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.760
Your chambers are ready, sir.

10:21.200 --> 10:21.200
Would you like 
to rest before lunch?

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.230
Elanora may rest. 
We have work to do.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.760
As you wish.

10:28.360 --> 10:28.360
With your permission.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.560
What is the latest development about the prisoners?

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.100
I gave that duty to my brother Bisol.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.730
They will hand over Numan and his family
to Kara Toygar.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.130
For the others, I waited for you.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.600
Good.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.400
Where are they taking us, father?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.430
To our palace, son.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.500
We will be free there, right?

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.800
Until eternity, son.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.660
Until eternity.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.500
So out fate was to return to Konya like this.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.230
To the palace we were born in and
grew up, to be killed by our uncle.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.030
I won’t let anyone harm you or
your brother, my daughter.

12:19.520 --> 12:19.520
Hah!

12:22.480 --> 12:22.480
Ya!

12:24.080 --> 12:24.080
Hah!

12:26.320 --> 12:26.320
Hah!

12:27.440 --> 12:27.440
Ya!

12:28.800 --> 12:28.800
Hah!

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.160
This way Kara Toygar will be
dependent on us more than ever.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.000
It is very important for him to win
the favor of Sultan Aladdin.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.700
Kara Toygar's senior role
in the Seljukian Palace will relieve us.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.430
Kara Toygar Caravansary

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.630
-We did everything as you ordered, commander.

12:53.400 --> 12:53.400
-Alright!

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.400
Exciseman!

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.000
Are the Turkmen tribes 

13:00.200 --> 13:00.200
paying their taxes?

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.360
We can’t control them, commander.

13:03.200 --> 13:03.200
They are always on the move.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.360
-Which one is the biggest tribe?
-Kayi tribe, commander.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.760
They ran away from the Mongol invasion.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.130
-Who is their leader?
-Suleyman Shah.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.760
-How many tents?
-2000 tents.

13:14.040 --> 13:14.040
But they are well respected.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.360
-Do they pay their taxes?
-They do, commander.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.630
Good.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.560
Then, they shall pay their taxes
earlier this year.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.430
But, commander...

13:26.840 --> 13:26.840
You heard what I said.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.060
How will this state remain standing?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.700
-Inform all the tribes in the region immediately.
-Yes, commander.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.460
Where are those Templars?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.030
Halt!

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.230
Let us rest a bit here.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.160
Check the surroundings.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.500
We need to weaken the Seljuks
before the crusade.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.330
You should put more men
in the Seljuk Palace, Titus.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.430
You can be sure that we will invade the palace...

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.600
There is a group in the Papacy,

14:25.720 --> 14:25.720
who are reluctant about the crusade.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.160
I am not surprised.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.360
We need to make a plan that will mobilize
the whole of Europe.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.200
We need to do this.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.600
The Christian world should unite

14:40.240 --> 14:40.240
and act for Jerusalem.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.330
For this, we need to provoke the Muslims 

14:45.360 --> 14:45.360
and make them attack us.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.660
I have some very valuable prisoners.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.400
We can start with them.

14:52.840 --> 14:52.840
Ih!

14:54.200 --> 14:54.200
Ah!

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.200
Calm down, son.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.460
Yigit.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.200
Bisol...

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.160
...you can go to hell.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.000
Take us to our destination quickly.

15:10.320 --> 15:10.320
So you are very keen to die.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.730
I pity for your beautiful daughter and your little Shahzada.

15:17.560 --> 15:17.560
Hıh.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.560
We don’t need your pity.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.000
If you had accepted to be allied with us,

15:23.280 --> 15:23.280
you were to become the Seljuk Sultan...

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.730
...and everything was going to be fine.

15:26.880 --> 15:26.880
You offered slavery 
for the Pope.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.130
We offered you peace...

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.560
...and a new world order.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.200
We wanted to live side by side.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.530
But...

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.330
...the Muslim blood will always be shed.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.630
There is no escape from this.

15:44.120 --> 15:44.120
We also ally

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:50.160
And we will shed your blood 
with the Muslim allies we have.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.300
You will not succeed.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.360
We will see.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.430
Ha.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.800
...to all your men I had sent to hell...

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.360
...give them my regards.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.630
The area is safe, commander.

16:03.480 --> 16:03.480
Good. Water the horses.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.100
These too.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.400
Come on!

16:13.560 --> 16:13.560
-Come on!
-Yeah!

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.130
-Come on!
-Yeah!

16:17.040 --> 16:17.040
Come on!

16:18.440 --> 16:18.440
Oh God!

16:21.840 --> 16:21.840
Hey!

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.430
You two, go and sit somewhere else.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.700
I brought you water. Take it.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.060
Take it.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.800
Come on.

17:23.480 --> 17:23.480
Ah! Ah!

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.160
No one is coming.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.760
Key! Take the key.

17:43.760 --> 17:43.760
Hungry.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.760
Come on, my girl.

17:55.440 --> 17:55.440
Quickly.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.200
We are in luck.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.000
The prisoners are running away!

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.160
-Quick, run!
-Get them!

18:41.680 --> 18:41.680
-Quick, run!
-Come here!

18:43.920 --> 18:43.920
-Escape!
-Run! Run!

19:39.920 --> 19:39.920
Ah!

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.260
-Father!
-Father!

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.730
-Are you alright?
-Father!

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.330
-Quick, take your brother and get out of here.
-No way! No way!

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.200
Father! Father!

20:20.400 --> 20:20.400
Halime!

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.560
Quick! Run away!

20:24.600 --> 20:24.600
-Get out of here
-Father!

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.300
-Take your brother and get the hell out of here!
-Father.

20:41.920 --> 20:41.920
Ah!

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.400
Come on, father! Get up! Come on!

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.600
So you tried to run away! You will pay for this.

21:06.800 --> 21:06.800
Ah!

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.360
Father!

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.100
Father!

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.530
Please help us, God.

21:29.000 --> 21:29.000
Here.

21:31.880 --> 21:31.880
Ah!

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.200
Great God!

21:40.760 --> 21:40.760
Ah!

21:43.200 --> 21:43.200
Ah!

21:45.040 --> 21:45.040
Aa aa!

21:49.760 --> 21:49.760
Ya aa!

21:54.840 --> 21:54.840
Aa aa!

21:56.840 --> 21:56.840
Ah!

22:01.320 --> 22:01.320
Ah!

22:04.160 --> 22:04.160
Ah!

22:07.720 --> 22:07.720
Ah!

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.760
-Father!
-Father!

22:11.440 --> 22:11.440
Ah!

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.430
Father

22:26.960 --> 22:26.960
stay with us, please!

22:31.280 --> 22:31.280
Ah!

22:38.760 --> 22:38.760
Aa aa!

22:48.200 --> 22:48.200
Ah!

22:59.280 --> 22:59.280
Baba dayan tamam.

23:30.680 --> 23:30.680
Ah!

23:33.960 --> 23:33.960
Ah!

23:40.320 --> 23:40.320
Ah! Ah!

23:50.400 --> 23:50.400
Aa aa!

23:52.760 --> 23:52.760
Ah!

24:13.920 --> 24:13.920
Aa aa!

24:25.120 --> 24:25.120
Aa aa!

24:56.440 --> 24:56.440
Ah! Ah!

24:57.920 --> 24:57.920
Ah! Ah!

25:00.120 --> 25:00.120
Ah! Ah!

25:23.200 --> 25:23.200
Ah! Ah!

25:24.400 --> 25:24.400
Ah! Ah!

25:43.000 --> 25:43.000
Ah!

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.460
It’s your lucky day, you had the Crusaders.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.800
Stay with us. Be strong, father.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.160
-Turgut Alp quick, bring some oak leaves.
-Yes sir.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.300
If we are successful, all the borders
in the region will change.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.730
For the salvation of Jerusalem

26:26.080 --> 26:26.080
we should not refrain from 
spending our cult’s fortune.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.360
We are ready to spend the whole treasury.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.160
A new Jerusalem campaign 
for young men

26:37.600 --> 26:37.600
will be the easiest way to become rich.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.130
To be a soldier 
of the Crusader army

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.100
they will join the army.

26:47.120 --> 26:47.120
The Catalans, the Venetians

26:50.120 --> 26:50.120
the Marseilleans...

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.160
...they all will long to join to this carnival.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.100
Well...

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.260
What about the spoilt princes of Europe?

27:03.080 --> 27:03.080
How will we trust them?

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.060
It won’t be difficult while the Muslims are busy...

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.630
...fighting each other, Titus.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.600
What about the Seljuks, sir?

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.600
Anatolia.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.700
They are at the peak of their power
with Sultan Aladdin.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:28.200
The day we can set Turks against
Saladin Ayyubi's grandsons...

27:25.760 --> 27:25.760
The day they fight each other

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.400
...we will be victorious.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.460
Jerusalem will be ours.

27:51.080 --> 27:51.080
Ah!

27:57.560 --> 27:57.560
Ah!

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.700
Father, please be strong.

28:01.640 --> 28:01.640
Ah! Ah!

28:14.040 --> 28:14.040
OK. It ends, father.

28:19.400 --> 28:19.400
OK

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.000
We have to be on our way as soon as possible.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.260
You can go.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.760
We can look after ourselves.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.700
It will get dark soon.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.230
The jackals would have already smelled the blood.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.800
Bamsi Beyrek, Dogan

28:40.320 --> 28:40.320
bring the horses.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.160
It is easy to fend off a Crusader brigade.
What about this?

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.600
Ertugrul is lost now.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.560
God always helps those who get lost.

28:54.400 --> 28:54.400
He is lost real bad now.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.060
Come on.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.800
So, what are you doing all alone?

29:02.800 --> 29:02.800
I said we won’t go.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.760
We owe you a life.

29:10.000 --> 29:10.000
We will pay our debt one day.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.030
Tell us your name.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.000
Ertugrul from Kayi tribe.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.160
As you wish.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.300
May God be with you. I wish you good luck.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.260
We should go 

29:23.960 --> 29:23.960
with them.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.530
Is your tribe far?

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.560
Even our money for bad days is finished,
Brother Afsin.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.130
We can set shop here.

30:14.560 --> 30:14.560
If we see that they are not interested, 

30:16.320 --> 30:16.320
we can go on.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.700
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you. 

30:21.320 --> 30:21.320
Welcome.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.700
Welcome, Gazanfar Aga.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.060
You bring joy to Kayi tribe.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:52.300
Kurdoglu, my brother. 

30:49.760 --> 30:49.760
You always look very healthy, thanks to God.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:56.230
Would these moorlands keep a man healthy, 

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.730
-for us to be healthy, Gazanfar?
-No, don’t say that. 

30:56.240 --> 30:56.240
You look very well.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.330
Where is your caravan?

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.660
The caravan is near the black rock.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.130
I came to ask permission from Suleyman Shah 

31:04.600 --> 31:04.600
to set up a stall 
in the market.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.730
How is business?

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.630
We thank God for what he gives.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.530
I wanted to come to Kayi to supply whatever they need 

31:12.720 --> 31:12.720
before the journey.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.100
Thank you, Gazanfar. 

31:16.400 --> 31:16.400
I hope you meet your expectations, if God permits.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.300
Thank you.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.560
If Suleyman Shah is available,
I would like to meet him.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.300
Tell our Bey that 
Gazanfar Aga is here.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.760
How much is this?

31:48.440 --> 31:48.440
He cannot speak, my Bey. Let me help you.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.600
80 coins.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.460
You look familiar to me.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.100
This is my first time in your tribe, my Bey.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.400
You probably took me for someone else.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.000
Peace be upon you, Suleyman Shah.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.630
And peace be upon you, trader. 

32:26.320 --> 32:26.320
Welcome.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.530
You bring joy to us. Come and sit.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:40.030
Suleyman Bey

32:35.640 --> 32:35.640
I’m so pleased to see you again Suleyman Shah.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.000
how happy they are sir.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.130
Please accept my presents sir.

32:42.440 --> 32:42.440
I brought them
from Constantinople for you.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.130
You did not have to bother.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.560
Kurdoglu

32:52.240 --> 32:52.240
give these to those in need.

32:54.200 --> 32:54.200
As you wish, my Bey.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:57.560
Well?

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.730
Tell us now. What did those eyes see in
other parts of the world?

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.100
I wish I were deaf so that I hadn’t heard what I heard.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.700
I wish I were blind so that I hadn’t seen what I saw, my Bey.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.330
What happened?

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.430
Sultan Aladdin recovered Konya but...

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.700
...he worries that the fugitive Shahzadas
may give him trouble.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.130
The Latins ransacked Constantinople.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.160

All Orthodox people left the city.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.060
There is no order, no peace...

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:26.160
...and with the famine now,

33:23.080 --> 33:23.080
everyone is desperate.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.130
We heard that the leftovers from
the Crusaders were getting restless.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.460
It is obvious that they are up to something once again.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.000
Well...

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.160
...how are the common people?

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.600
They will be on the road again
to find something to eat.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:45.200
The rumor is that the Pope is calling for
a new crusade to the European princes.

33:42.320 --> 33:42.320
It is said to have called for, sir.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.800
And we Muslims fight 
against each other.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.200
Sowing discord between us,

33:51.600 --> 33:51.600
fueling the disorder as much as possible.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.460
From Anatolia to Basra, everywhere is on fire.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.560
This fire will catch us as well, my Bey.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.030

Please don’t say fire, it upsets me, my Bey.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.600
I came to seek permission to sell
my goods in your tribe.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.690
You have our permission.

34:08.080 --> 34:08.080
Thank you.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.000
Kara Toygar 

34:20.080 --> 34:20.080
has come to the region
to control the Turkmen tribes.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.500
So, we have difficult days ahead.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.160
And this girl is from Venetia. Rosalina, she has noble blood.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.030
A white skin, green eyes.

34:38.720 --> 34:38.720
A rare find, commander.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.560
And she is very cheap as well.

34:42.080 --> 34:42.080
I am in urgent need of money.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.560
This is a very good opportunity
for you and me.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.160
What do you say to this, commander?

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.430
They kidnapped her from the Greek Islands.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.330
She screams beauty 
and freshness.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.000
She is a wild mare.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.000
I tamed her myself 

35:01.080 --> 35:01.080
for a master with good taste.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.030
What about that blond one?

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.300
I must say that you have good taste.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.330
I bought her from the Crusader discards.

35:12.480 --> 35:12.480
They brought her in with a ship. She is Serbian

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.000
-She knows how to treat a man.
-Enough.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.100
Come here.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.600
You don’t need to be afraid of me.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.200
I am your master now.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.660
You chose the most expensive one, commander.

35:48.720 --> 35:48.720
But she is worth it.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.260
Sir?

35:59.880 --> 35:59.880
What happened?

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.700
The Crusaders.

36:03.000 --> 36:03.000
They were ambushed.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.030
Didn’t you save them?

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.560
We were too late.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.600
So you were late.

36:12.760 --> 36:12.760
Ah!

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.160
Akcakoca, we have a wounded man.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.100
Bamsi

37:16.200 --> 37:16.200
take him in.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.300
-What happened, Turgut?
-Nothing to worry about.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.560
You are alright, yes?

37:33.360 --> 37:33.360
We all are, thank God.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.800
Ertugrul...

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.800
...what happened, brother?

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.400
They were attacked, brother.

37:56.760 --> 37:56.760
I will tell you later.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.460
Look after them, Hamza.

38:12.080 --> 38:12.080
As you wish, my Bey.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.360
Who are they, Gundogdu?

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.260
I don’t know. He will tell us later.

38:22.440 --> 38:22.440
We will find out soon.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.500
Sister, 

38:33.640 --> 38:33.640
what is happening? Who are they?

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.100
We will find out soon.

38:37.640 --> 38:37.640
We will see.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.560
The sword hit him right below the rib.

38:45.560 --> 38:45.560
Fortunately, the oak leaves 
stopped the bleeding

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.630
otherwise, we would have lost him.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.100
Midwife

38:52.440 --> 38:52.440
-bring hot water.
-At once, Akcakoca.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.330
The leg is bad as well.

38:59.680 --> 38:59.680
But we should deal with the wound first.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.660
Akcakoca can take it from here.
Let us wait outside.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.530
-We cannot leave our father alone, sister.
-Don’t worry.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.600
Your father is in good hands.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.460
Thank you very much. You are God sent.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.060
-We brought trouble to you.
-Don’t say that.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.260
You had more breaths to take,
more bites to eat.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.360
Where were the Crusaders taking you?

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.760
I don’t know. They didn’t say.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:04.130
I guess they were going to sell us in
the slave market. My father is a trader.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.360
We were captured in the Mediterranean.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.700
Your father must be a good trader.
Having so many Crusaders taking you.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.760
Yes.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.500
We were rich.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.060
But we don’t have anything left now.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.330
Well...

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.330
...which tribe is this?

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.500
You are in Kayi tribe.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.360
I am the son of
the tribe Bey, Suleyman Shah.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.360
We owe you three lives.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.200
-Do you want to be freed from slavery?
-Yes.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.330
-Then, kill this man.
-No!

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.100
I will buy you and then free you.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.430
Commander, you are furious.
First calm down...

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.700
Shut your mouth.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.000
Don’t let me kill you as well.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.000
Sir, please spare me for my children.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.700
You are good for nothing.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.060
Do it!

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.700
-I can’t.
-I said do it!

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.360
I’m freeing you!

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:22.130
A slave that can kill someone
to be free...

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.600
...can kill her master one day as well.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.160
Get ready, we are going!
