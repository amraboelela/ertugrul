00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.430
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.530
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.060
Wake up, my son.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.100
Dear God, we thank you.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.860
What did you do, did you kill him?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.500
Don’t kill him!

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.930
-Why did you kill him?
-What is happening here?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.130
We learned many things from you,
your highness.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.530
In your cities, we have to guard
our weapons and our lives as well.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.560
Who is this man, Nasir?

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.460
A Templar.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.230
What did you talk about during dinner?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.260
What does he want from El Aziz?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.960
Kayis.
They wanted a quarter to stay in winter.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.530
Kayis must get what they want.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.860
What do you mean? I don’t understand.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.500
The territory they get, make it near Antioch 
where the Earldom of the Crusaders is.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.930
This is an opportunity to kill
not only Ertugrul but all his blood.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.830
Kayis may spend the winter in the skirts
of the Amanos Mountains...

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.600
...somewhere very remote,
near the border of Antioch Countship.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.900
This will be their last winter.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.600
Titus, are you aware of
what you are saying?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.260
You are playing with fire!

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.200
Do as I tell you, Nasir.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.160
Follow them everywhere.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.160
You will report every move he makes,
every breath he takes back to me.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.960
Take these pigeons.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.060
You became the hero of the tribe all of
a sudden, you don’t even talk to me now.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.360
Suleyman Shah is not giving
his goods for us to sell.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.500
We came to the tribe for nothing.
Come on, help me prepare the caravan.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.060
-I am not coming.
-I don’t buy your heroic attitude, Afsin.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.860
I took you with me while
you were starving.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.560
I gave you food and water, made you a man!

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.300
Now you cannot turn against me.
You owe me.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.060
-May you heal soon.
-Thank you, my Bey.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.030
It is not very common...

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.830
...for someone to be such a good trader
and swordsman at the same time.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.100
You fought well yesterday night 
even though you were wounded!

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.830
The helper of the trader is
also just like you.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.120
If I were a good trader, I would not have
been left out with children and no money.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.360
As for fighting, we just know to have fun 
with swords among ourselves.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360
That's all.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.920
If God permits, soon we won’t be a burden anymore!

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.560
This is our only consolation,
Numan Effendi.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.300
Our only consolation.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.030
So, you say I owe you.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.860
Look at me, you sneaky man!
I've worked for you like a dog for years...

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.060
...and I paid my debt to you! Now get out
of my face before I rip your head off.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.800
Get lost!

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.400
One is a trader...

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.860
...the other one is a caravan worker.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.500
But they are first-class swordsmen.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.860
You found each other well.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:34.230
For some reason, I don’t wonder about
who Kara Toygar’s man inside the tribe is.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.100
What are you doing?

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.060
-Selcan.
-Stop! Don’t!

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.200
This is a sin! You cannot precede over
what God permits for you!

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.360
If we had a baby,
everything would be different.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.330
My Hatun.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.930
We will have a baby one day.
We should not lose hope from God.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.860
Your mother...

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.360
...is about to crown Halime
the first chance she gets.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.100
Selcan...

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.830
...it's enough!

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.400
You are not aware of
the things going on around you.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.830
You don’t know the respect
she showed her in the weaving area.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.800
She shows her the respect
she refrains from me.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.260
She treats me as if I am not
her son’s wife but a mere servant.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.130
Why?
Because I did not give her a grandson yet.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.860
She hates me.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.830
Selcan.
You are accusing my mother without reason.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.000
That would never be her intention.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.530
I know what goes through her mind.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.230
Look, woman, I cannot listen to
your whining right before the caravan...

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.460
...alright? For the love of God.
-You don’t understand, do you?

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.060
I am saying that Halime and her family will stay here forever but you don’t even care about this!

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.600
God give me patience, patience.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.800
Gundogdu came out of his rage
very quickly, thank God.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.260
He deserved to lead the caravan.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.360
Just like he deserved to carry wood.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.230
If God permits, he will manage
to beat his arrogance as well.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.600
If God permits, Hayme. If God permits.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.960
He organized the caravan very quickly.
That is not easy at all.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.330
He works day and night,
fighting tooth and nail.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.130
May God let him succeed.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.800
-Sometimes...
-Sometimes what?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.130
-Nothing.
-Hayme, what is on your mind?

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.030
I don’t know, my Bey.
I get anxious about many things.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.830
Don’t you worry.
They will both return safe and sound.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.600
If God permits. If God permits.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.960
Halime, come on,
let us go and eat something.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.860
-Aykiz, I will come after I finish this.
-Alright, I will be waiting.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.530
-Sister, what have you done?
-This is not the time to question me.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.060
-What did you throw inside the cauldron?
-I am trying to save you from that girl.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.060
Sister, what you did is not right.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.430
Moreover, the problem is not Halime here,
it is the caravan.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.000
Gokce, why are you so empty-headed?
Haven’t you still grasped the problem?

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.030
The biggest disaster that happened 
to this tribe is that girl.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.160
When will you understand this?
When Ertugrul weds her?

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.160
Do we have permission, my Bey?

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:35.160
My Bey, we put you in a difficult situation.
We want you to forgive us.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.160
If you make a mistake like this again,
you would not find the opportunity...

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.500
...to come before me
and ask for forgiveness.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.030
My Bey, his highness Ameer
would like to see you.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.460
Come, the brave boy of the steppes, come.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.060
I owe you an apology for
the things that happened last night.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.860
Whoever is behind this attempt, my uncle
will find and punish them accordingly.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.460
-Uncle.
-We decided to...

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.500
...give you the territory you requested,
son of a Bey.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.430
If you want the truth,
Nasir persuaded us to do so.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.430
Do you know this place?
West of the Asi River.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.860
-I heard that the land was fertile.
-There are many enemies as well!

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.000
It is at the border of the people
who came to kill you last night.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.060
So we can sleep side by side
with the devil.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.900
Is it worth to take this risk
for your herds?

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.130
The enemy keeps us alive and alert all the time.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.560
Awesome, awesome, awesome. I love
these braves from the steppes, uncle.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.230
So, you want to test your fate in the face
of the scorpion needle. Is that so?

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.330
If you are so willing to sleep
side by side with the devil...

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.330
...all we can say is good luck to you.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.830
We are impressed by
your courage once again.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.000
When we have friends like you behind us...

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.960
...we would never refrain from
facing the enemy upfront.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.390
Are you still thinking about
what Gokce said, Halime?

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.900
No. Why would her words concern me?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.230
-It is between Ertugrul and Gokce.
-So you don’t care?

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:37.130
You have been worrying about yourself for two days! 
Am I blind, Halime?

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.030
-Aykiz, please, let us focus on our work.
-Alright but...

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.200
...please don’t take that mad girl
Gokce seriously.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.060
She is building castles in the air!

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.060
Maybe Mother Hayme and Gokce already...

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.900
Aykiz?

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.260
For it to take this color,
pheasant’s eye seeds must be added.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.300
Halime, who would do this?

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.260
Anyhow, there is a solution
for everything.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.230
The caravan is about to leave,
how will we make it in time?

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.460
We will, Aykiz. There is no other way.
We will make it in time.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.600
We are leaving.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.530
Let us go and see our tribe’s
new territory.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.030
-Ertugrul Bey?
-So El Aziz...

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.860
Let us not make our new land wait for us.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:46.060
I don’t want Gundogdu, my father in law
or Mother Hayme to know that I came here.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.160
Don’t worry. No one will know.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.860
Especially that man, Suleyman Shah,
will never know!

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.600
As you asked,
I brought a lock of Gundogdu’s hair.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.430
You are the daughter of a big Bey, Selcan.
You don’t deserve these things.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.680
Your mother in law always humiliates you and...

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.920
...your husband thinks you are not fertile…
-Enough!

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.500
Do not be ashamed of the pains you lived
through. You shall get all you deserve.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.430
The spirit army shall fill
your stomach with the seeds of your man.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.860
You will have a son.
And the fate of Kayi tribe will change.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.930
Hamza, we will leave early in the morning.
Check the weapons of the Alps...

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.030
...make sure they have plenty of arrows.
-As you wish, my Bey.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.930
-May it be easy.
-Thank you, uncle.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.330
I thought about it and...

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.860
...I don’t think it is a good idea for you
to be going with the caravan, Gundogdu.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:11.960
Why is that?

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.800
We don’t know what that Kara Toygar dog
may be up to.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.780
Even if you take the best Alps with you,
this is very dangerous.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.100
You are the son of a Bey. Ertugrul is not here
either and your father is ill.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.030
It would be best if you find
a way to stay in the tribe.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.130
Uncle, would it suit a son of a Bey
to drowse around in the tribe?

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.560
Look around you. All these people have
trusted their goods with me.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.830
Of course, it should be
my duty to take them.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.960
If that dog Kara Toygar makes a move, we
shall do all that we can, with God's help.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.560
Do not worry about it.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.100
We made everything ready, Mother Hayme.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.060
Gokce finished the carpets.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.800
May your hands be blessed. If God permits,
they will find their worth in the market.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.560
And I wove this for you, Mother Hayme.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.930
My pure girl, my clean girl.
You are one of a kind.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.460
When did you find the time
during all this hassle?

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.120
She has not slept for days, Mother Hayme.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.830
God bless.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.130
Halime, what will we do?

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.800
Why did they become like this, Halime?

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.400
I am guessing that we did not use
enough dung, Mother Hayme.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.030
We will try it again.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.800
You did your best.
It would never be ready by the morning.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.600
No! If necessary, we won’t sleep 
to make them ready, Mother Hayme.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.500
Do not worry.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.500
One last hope? Alright.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.260
May it be easy.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.200
Welcome, son of a Bey.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.200
I wanted Ibn Arabi's blessing
before setting off.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.800
Sheikh Effendi already left,
don’t you know?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.600
-To where?
-God knows.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.900
-Won’t I see him again?
-Only God knows.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.430
-I need to find him.
-How can you find, if you have not lost it?

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.200
How can you lose, if you have not found it?

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.460
This was the stupidest thing
you could have done, Titus.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.860
You did not manage to revenge your brother
and made Kayis a bigger problem for us.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.560
Sir, I did the right thing.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.960
You did the right thing, is that so?

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.830
-I did not expect such stupidity from you.
-Sir.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.030
I don’t understand who we are afraid of.
Of Ertugrul or the person with him...

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.930
...Ibn Arabi?

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.200
How dare you say that I am frightened?

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.000
Listen to me carefully, Titus.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.000
We will never let the Turks
come to our borders, never!

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.460
If your desire for revenge precedes
your duty one more time...

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.500
...I would bury you beside
your brother with my own hands.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.160
Great God, you make everything possible.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.930
This must be heaven.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.560
But hell is right around the corner.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.560
Yes, beyond this territory is Antioch, 
the Earldom of the Crusaders!

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.060
Secret fort of the Templars
must be somewhere around here.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.000
Devil is everywhere, Turgut.
In our tribe, in Aleppo. Everywhere.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.530
We will have a lot of fun, a lot!

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.930
God bless, my Bey. You can find water
under every stone you turn.

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.460
I never saw such fertile land in my life.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:11.430
It will grow the babies, fatten the sheep.
It will give life to the tribe.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.400
How did they let such
a nice land to be uninhabited?

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.930
Because it is right next to hell, Turgut.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.560
Yes, my Bey.
Why did these Templars want to kill you?

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.460
I am guessing that they want to
avenge the knights we killed.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.900
My Bey, so we can say that they will not let
us find peace here as well.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.060
Forget the heretics...

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.460
...think about your wedding with Aykiz.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.000
As soon as the tribe settles here,
our first job will be to wed you.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.060
God willing, my Bey.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.020
Lucky you!

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.440
If she were someone else,
she would have wed another man long ago.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.900
My Bey...

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.930
...maybe we will have two weddings.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.830
Our flags shall be our tents. We shall
ride our horses to borderless plains.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.330
Our weapons shall be our lovers
and our armies shall be strong.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.130
Our crest shall fly over seven climates
as the flag of justice.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.460
We shall carry our divine message
beyond the mountains and seas.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.830
You have dug your own grave!

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.160
You have been breathing down
on our necks since Aleppo.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.400
Tell me! Who holds your leash?

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.860
He is dead!

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.400
These are messenger pigeons, my Bey.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.530
Then, let us send them to their owner.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.560
Dear God, thank you.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.900
The long-awaited has come.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.560
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:57.000
Didn’t you come here because of the incubus 
you have Petruchio?

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.830
I don’t believe any of the prophecies 
that the heretic Arabi from Andalusia told...

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.990
...my dear brother Giovanni.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.160
Don’t call me Giovanni.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.830
My name is Omer.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.830
You know very well that everything
my Sheikh Ibn Arabi has said came true.

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:25.100
The storm of stars is the herald of the awaited leader!

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:31.160
Will these herd of shepherds running away
from the Mongols rule the whole world?

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.400
They will unite the whole Muslim world
as a fist.

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:41.400
And that fist will throw a punch,
demolishing your cursed order.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.430
Did you take enough water, Gundogdu?

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.900
You won’t find water while passing
the Kenger Mountain.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.060
We did, my Bey. We didn’t want to take too
much as it would be heavy for the animals.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.600
-Good. Is there anything left behind?
-There is. Aykiz and Halime.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.500
Let me run and check them.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.400
They are coming.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.500
We apologize for being late.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.900
-Are they finished?
-All of them, Mother Hayme.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.930
How did they turn out?
Are they worth taking to the market?

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.400
Let me see one.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.160
How is it, Hanim, is it good?

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.600
I have never seen such vibrant colors
in my life.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.000
Good. Load these drapes as well.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.460
The caravan may leave.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.100
Come.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:57.100
The caravan left the village, commander.
Suleyman Shah’s son Gundogdu is leading.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.830
Come closer. Come to me.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.400
The flood has passed and sand is left.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.860
Thank God! We were not helpless 
in front of our husbands.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.430
You worked very hard. After cleaning up,
you may all go and rest.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.600
Come on now. Selcan, come with me.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.000
There is an issue
I wanted to talk with you for a long time.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.600
I am listening, mother.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.540
My girl, after your mother and
father died...

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.920
...you and your sister Gokce 
were entrusted with us.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.320
I have always tried to look after you 
as my own children!

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.500
May our lives be sacrificed for you,
Mother Hayme.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:53.100
Have we done something bad by mistake?
Did we break your heart?

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.060
No, nothing like that. The thing I want
to say is completely different.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.400
Gokce has grown, she got very beautiful.
She became such a young lady.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.060
We need to wed her soon.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:12.960
You are right mother, it has been on my mind 
for a long time too.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.860
Well...

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.100
...who are we going to wed her with?

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.960
If you give consent as well, Ertugrul
and Gokce should grow old together.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.000
Please, Mother Hayme, who am I to have
a say in something like this?

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.560
Don’t say that.
You raised her since she was very little.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.130
I wanted to ask you first.
You can inquire and see her reaction.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.960
I will go immediately, Mother Hayme.
I am going right now.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.160
The pigeon wing’s final destination
is the wolf’s mouth.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.960
Suleyman Shah’s son, Ertugrul.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.860
Attack!

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.900
We expected a big welcome
with drums and all.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.060
-This is strange.
-Everyone must have finished their job.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.830
The caravan must be on its way as well.
Everyone is probably resting.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.130
You carry on. I will visit my father.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.030
Stop!
