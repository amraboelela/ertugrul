00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.720
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.920
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.300
We tried to stop the migration,
we did not succeed.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.700
We tried to kill Shah Suleyman,
we did not succeed.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.120
Don't mumble,
talk clearly so you can have inner peace.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.140
In the morning you sent that rabid boy
to Shah Suleyman but now we are going...

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.620
...to bid him farewell.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.320
I cannot make heads or tails 
of you, my Bey.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.880
If my mind could only see one step beyond,
my name would be Alpargu as well, my lion.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.480
I can predict the consequences 
before even taking actions...

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.400
...and that’s why I’m called Kurdoglu.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.960
What happened, sister?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.340
It is good news, my sister, good news.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.280
It’s good that you are setting off 
with mother Hayme...

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.200
...as long as you know how to achieve 
what you hope for.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.720
You've been looking after Suleyman Shah 
since he got sick.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.720
You will show the same care on the road and...

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.940
...you will help mother Hayme no matter what.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.420
Of course, sister,
you can rest assured.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.980
My naive sister.
You will impress Mother Hayme so deeply...

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.840
...that she will not even think about
a bride other than you. You will remind her...

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.880
...that you will be marrying Ertugrul
so that she cannot change her mind.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.740
What about Ertugrul?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.140
Does mother Hayme not know
that his heart is with that girl?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.700
Word once spoken is past recalling, Gokce.
It does not suit someone like...

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.680
...mother Hayme to play with the pride
and kill the dreams of an innocent...

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.960
...well-intentioned girl like you. If she
forgets it, you shall remind her.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.100
Sister, do you know why I am always
beside the sickbed of our Bey?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.360
You once told me that Ertugrul
would never go against his father's words.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.380
This will be over after our Bey says
that the two of us should get married.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.480
That is why.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.440
I always pray so that Suleyman Shah
can get better soon.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.460
-He should get better and...
-God forbid!

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.980
Instead of worthless prayers like that
you should pray that mother Hayme...

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.860
...stand strong in front of Ertugrul.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.660
Do all that is in your power so that
she insists on you to be her bride.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.180
May you find a remedy in the lands
you go if God permits.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.320
May you find a remedy so that you can
greet your tribe standing strong...

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.880
...in our new lands.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.720
Come closer.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.140
I ask for your blessing, mother.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.080
I bless you, my son.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.500
My father is entrusted to God first,
then to you.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.940
We neither know our enemy nor our ally.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.220
The road is full of traitors.
Be careful.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.400
And may you succeed in protecting
your tribe, your wife, and your child.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.660
When there is no peace and unity within
the tribe, migration is even harder.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.460
Your job is very difficult, son.
May God help you.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.620
Thank you, mother. Do not worry, from
the babies to goats, all life here...

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.780
...is entrusted to me. We shall reach
Aleppo safe and sound, if God permits.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.000
If God permits.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.340
Come on, Alps. In the name of God.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.440
May you flow like water, mother.
May troubles be left behind as you go.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.640
May you be blessed with new weddings
and grandchildren in our new lands.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.340
If God permits, my girl. If God permits.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.400
If God permits, we shall hear that
my blood brother has recovered.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.160
May God clear your road for this journey,
mother Hayme.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.120
-Godspeed, mother Hayme.
-The Alps will with be with you, thank God.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.860
But you should still be cautious.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.680
As you know, the enemy is everywhere.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.900
You do not need to worry about us,
Kurdoglu.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.520
Remember, Rahman.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.200
You witnessed last night that traitors 
never take their actions overtly.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.720
Hold tight.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.400
Halt.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.620
How is she, my Shahzada?

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.360
It would be wise to check her wound,
Ertugrul.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.440
Press this over the wound.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.240
We should not stay here for long.
It might be dangerous.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.700
We should leave as soon as possible.
We shall find help in Aleppo.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.820
Alright.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.440
Ertugrul.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.360
Will you be able to bear the pain, Halime?

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.460
I can, Ertugrul Bey.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.360
Amanos Mountains
Templars Castle

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.540
Please forgive my daughter
as she is innocent, Dear God.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.100
Your Mercifulness has no limits.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.960
You are The Retaliator...

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.480
...you are The All-Prevailing One.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.460
You are the Almighty and Capable of revenge.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.680
May You crush the tyrants.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.560
I am not the tyrant here. You know that.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.220
It was you who killed Elanora.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.400
You won’t have what you want from me...

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.180
...even if you kill me and bring me back 
thousand times.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.060
You were like this as a child as well.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.980
Stubbornness makes you unbearable.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.900
But I know how to break that stubbornness.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.440
I am getting old, Marcus.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.520
What was the name of the Bedouin
we met in Aleppo yesterday?

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.420
The famous Muhiddin Ibn Arabi
from Andalucía.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.820
Would you get over your stubbornness...

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.160
if I killed him once instead of killing you 
thousand times?

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.880
We both know that you cannot kill him.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.360
You are right.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.520
You were stubborn and clever 
like this as a child as well.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.040
In order to get my hands on that chest,
I need both of you alive.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:46.920
But this does not mean that I cannot throw
him in the dungeon right there.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:54.140
Will you be able to bear seeing him
getting weak day by day?

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.600
I seek refuge in God from Satan, the Accursed one.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.160
In the name of God, the Compassionate, 
the Merciful.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:13.060
And you (O Muhammad) will see the angels...

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:20.660
circling the Throne, glorifying their Lord 
with His praises;

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.260
and the people will be judged with full equity

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:43.520
and it will be said: “Praise is for God, 
the Lord of the Worlds!”

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.240
God the Most Mighty has spoken the truth.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:13:03.980
God send prayers upon Muhammad 
and upon the family of Muhammad.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.360
Take this as well.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.640
-May it be easy on you, Aykiz.
-Thank you.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.500
How is our Bey?

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.460
-He will be better, if God permits.
-If God permits.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.760
Is this your dowry?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.080
The first wedding of
the new camp will be yours.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.440
If God permits,
the second will be mine with Ertugrul.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.100
Gokce, I know that
your heart is with Ertugrul...

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.060
...but you know very well
that he sees you as his little sister.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.180
You start dreaming on your own
and start to believe your dreams...

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.100
...you will be heartbroken at the end.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.020
You are wrong, Aykiz.
This is not an illusion.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.620
Suleyman Shah also told Ertugrul.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.140
He told Ertugrul that
we shall get married after the migration.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.760
Come on, get ready! Our journey begins!

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.820
Do you think Ertugrul would accept this?

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.980
His heart is with Halime.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.480
You need to be blind not to see that.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.960
Please do not be so confident about this.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.000
That’s up to fate, sister.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.400
That's true.
You never know.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.520
Look at yourself, you are in love 
with Turgut since your childhood...

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.720
...but you haven’t got married yet.
Remember that, Aykiz.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.080
On the way to the groom's house, the bride
still says "whatever fate may hold."

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.480
You will either talk here and now...

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.620
...or I shall feed you to the dogs.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.800
I know that someone helped you
within the palace...

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.040
...give me a name...

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.380
...save your life.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.060
What is happening to this man?

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.060
This is poison!
Where did he find the poison?

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.040
-Has anyone else entered this room other than you?
-I don't think so.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.060
No one knew he was here.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.980
Even the guards don't know
who they are guarding.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.540
I could not get a single word out of him.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.560
I have to find the spies
who infiltrated the palace.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.140
Esma...

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.800
...no one should see this body.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.440
Whoever helped him die will come again
to see whether he died or not.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.140
My Effendi...

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.940
...with your permission...

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.360
...I can take care of the body.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.580
I know a way to get him out of here 
during the change of guards.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.340
Esma...

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.120
...I don't know how to repay my debt.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:11.020
You saved my life once and
now you are risking your life for me.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.420
It is an honor for me to work for
the vizier who sacrifices everything...

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.720
...for the righteous path of God.
You can rest assured.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.820
With God's permission, the traitor
who did this shall be punished.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.560
Petruccio, my dear friend.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.780
Cardinal.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.180
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.760
I hope your niece's death was not in vain.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.300
Elanora sacrificed herself for our cause.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.320
Was your niece's sacrifice beneficial?

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.420
I don't think so. You are not even
a step closer to the lost chest.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.660
Giovanni is still resisting...

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.900
...but he shall give in soon.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.300
I know his soft spot very well.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.020
How can you be so sure
that Giovanni will start talking?

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.380
I can tell our common friends in Aleppo.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.600
-With your brother?
-No. Giovanni is not my brother anymore.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.720
He chose to betray our cause.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.420
And he is paying the price of this choice.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.000
Petruccio, Petruccio,
not only the traitors...

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.140
...those who cannot succeed
in their duties also pay a price.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.720
If you want me to persuade
our Holy Father for the Crusades...

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.680
...you have to take back the holy relics
Muslims stole from us.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.040
I shall remind you of this every day
until I return to Europe...

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.760
...my dear friend Petruccio.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.720
-What is it, Marcus?
-Titus has returned to the castle, sir.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.000
Get your hands off me!

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.440
Let go!

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.140
Well done!

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.920
You went with 30 knights and
returned with two Turkmen, dear Titus.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.080
What a great task! Huge success!

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.320
This child is not
an ordinary Turkmen, Cardinal.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.560
He is a Seljuk Shahzada.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.280
Isn't he one of the Shahzadas
you let escape last time?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.800
Well, who is this?

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.920
Your death!

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.380
Well done, Titus. You are
quite brave against a wounded lion...

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.300
...but when you encounter lions in the
forest, who'll look for a hole to hide?

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.980
I am going to Antioch.
I have some business to attend to.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.940
I shall take back my guest when I get
back. Look after him well while I am gone.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.880
May you have a good journey, dear Thomas.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.560
Take our guest to his palace.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.660
Take him to the palace as well.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.620
This presumptuous Turkmen
shall beg for me to kill him.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.880
First, we shall visit a friend.
He will look after Halime and...

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.040
...we will receive his blessing.
-Alright.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.480
Be strong, my girl. We are almost there.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.680
You cowards! Why don't you untie me?
Are you afraid?

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.440
Do we treat your prisoners like this?

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.760
-Are you alright?
-Save your breath, young man.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.740
They won't hear you here.
They won't understand your troubles.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.620
Here, only God will hear you.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.460
Who are you?

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.940
I warned you countless times!

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.800
I told you that your revenge
should not overshadow your tasks!

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.600
But you went after that Turk anyway.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.340
I lost 30 knights
because of your incompetence.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.960
Forgive me, sir.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.560
Didn't you see how
the Cardinal was teasing us?

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.960
You disgraced me and 
all the Knights Templar.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.040
Never...

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.940
...ever ask me to forgive you once again.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.320
I understand, sir.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.880
-But...
-But what, Titus?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.260
Ertugrul was going to Aleppo.
I thought you might want to know this.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.020
He must be going to Aziz's palace
as an envoy of the Kayis.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.500
I shall give you one last chance, Titus.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.880
What is it you want me to do, sir?

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.680
Go to Aleppo immediately.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.180
Talk with Nasir and finish this job.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.400
Then clean your mess.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.880
I understand, sir.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.540
First, complete your tasks
for Lord's Son, Titus.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.700
Then, Ertugrul is yours.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.080
You can do whatever you wish.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.240
-Thank God you are here.
-Thank God we meet again.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.640
Where have you been, my Bey?

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.520
We were worried when you did not show up.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.520
Where is Turgut Alp?

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.920
-Father, where is Yigit Alp? He is not here.
-Keep calm, keep calm, my girl.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.460
I will call the doctor and
meet you in the lodge.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.380
May Lord’s Son take our deceased brother 
to his kingdom of heaven.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.500
Will his death make our job easier?

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.420
Aziz is really confused
about Sahabeddin at the moment.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.960
When the assassin is found dead
after accusing Sahabeddin...

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.040
...this will confuse him even more.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.740
The rest is up to you.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.820
You must feed fears
and suspicions within Aziz.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.840
I will be a guest of
the Emir tonight as well.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.000
In the sweetest moment of our night
I shall whisper Ustad's words in his ear.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.580
He will be my slave from now on.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.040
Aftalia.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.980
Don't get carried away
while doing your job.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.280
I am Esma to El Aziz and
Aftalia to you and your Knights Templar.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.600
I only do as I’m told.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.380
Shall I take the tray
if you won't eat, my Effendi?

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.460
Father?

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.440
Yigit still has not arrived, father.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.340
Father, Yigit has not arrived.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.560
May God help and be with us.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.660
Dear God,
please don't leave us in despair.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.080
Amen. She shall recover.
May God bestow a speedy recovery upon her.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.000
Hanim, how is our guest?

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.560
The doctor said that she should regain
consciousness by the morning, God willing.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.600
We should go to the lodge.
Our Sheikh would like to see you.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.920
Is Ibn Arabi here?

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.580
You can go, Ertugrul. I will wait here.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.520
What is this outrage?
How can you come in without permission?

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:58.220
Kurdoglu, people are entering Shah's tent
not by the door but from the back...

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.600
...and you still request permission.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.640
Get to the point, Gundogdu.
Say what you have to say.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.020
I will not say anything to you until
my father opens his eyes, Kurdoglu.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.620
But when he opens his eyes,
not only candles...

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.520
...but even if all the stars in heaven go out,
no one can take you away from me.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.380
By the way...

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.020
...a bow and arrow are good.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.900
You don't need to get face to face
like you do with a sword or a dagger.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.240
Welcome, son.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.120
You are always welcome here.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.280
I’m very much pleased to see you.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.860
May she recover soon. Our Pir's
grandson told us what happened.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.880
My Effendi, when I first came to Aleppo,
the Knights Templar wanted to kill me...

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.980
...but we were saved with your help.
I saw you in my dream.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.440
Help is from God, don't ever forget
that He is the source of all favors...

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.060
...and don't ever tell
your brothers your dreams.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.240
His highness Joseph also had a dream.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.960
He told it to his father
for him to interpret it.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.680
What was Prophet Jacob's
first reply to him?

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.120
Don’t ever talk about your dreams 
to your brothers.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.880
Do not forget...

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:17.000
...if you don't keep one secret, the Owner
of Secrets will not give you another one.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.060
I understand.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.860
Look, our guest is here.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.980
He has secrets,
he respects the Owner of Secrets.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.040
May God keep his blessing over us.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.400
It was Sultan Gilani's statement:
"Birds fly with their kind.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.960
Eagles with eagles, crows with crows."

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.840
Our job was to bring the eagles together.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.960
Thank God.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.600
You are entrusted first in God,
then with each other.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.760
You can discuss everything together.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.160
What do the Templars want from you?

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.780
Brother Dogan?

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.860
Yes, my brother?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.700
Do you think Turgut Alp and
Yigit will be here in the morning?

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.120
I do not know, brother Bamsi.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.280
We fended off so many troubles
while we were together.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.560
The Mongols and Crusaders...

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.860
...wolves and bears...

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.980
...snow and winter did not stop us.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.140
Now those knights...

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.340
I do not know, brother Bamsi.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.000
I don’t want to say what is in my heart...

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.540
...and my heart won’t let me say 
what is on my mind.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.660
Where is this Afsin Bey? He said he would
be back by nightfall but he is not.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.420
I do not know that either, brother Bamsi.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.700
We do not know anything about him.
May God bless us with a good ending.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.700
Is it true that there is a plague in the Kayi tribe?

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.520
Plague?

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.340
I was surprised when I heard it as well.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.000
But our commander Nasir said that
he got such an intelligence.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.100
There was no plague when I left the tribe.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.980
But we caught someone who was trying
to contaminate the tribe's food...

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.160
...with plagued meat.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.820
She said that the Templars had ordered it.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.840
Why are they behind everything?

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.640
If the news of a plague
in our tribe reached Aleppo before me...

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.580
...it means that
the Templars are behind it.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.200
How much do you trust
this commander called Nasir?

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.000
I do not trust anyone
in the palace anymore, Ertugrul.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.220
When I was just about to catch
the man who tried to kill me...

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.520
Stop, don't!

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.140
Nasir killed him for no reason at all.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.580
He was still alive.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.860
I questioned him when he recovered.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.500
But yesterday,
he killed himself in front of me.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.240
So what are you planning to do?

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.040
First thing tomorrow
I will tell El Aziz about Nasir.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.680
My nephew will not turn
a deaf ear to my warnings this time.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.940
Do not touch her.
Do not touch and move away.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.800
Midwife, what is happening?
For God's sake please help her.
