00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.560
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.900
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.300
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.400
Aleppo

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.230
You wait around here.
I will be back shortly.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.460
Peace be upon you.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.830
And peace be upon you.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.300
I am looking for a book.
“Mawaqi al-Nujum.”

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.600
Science and Positions of the Stars.
Do you have it?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.940
Of course.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.300
What do you expect to learn
from that book?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.560
I am after what everyone else
is seeking to learn.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.500
I want to predict the future 
by observing the stars

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.230
Maybe the author did not write
the book with that intention.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.030
I want to buy this. How much is it?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.100
Accept it as a gift.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.960
In the name of God, the Compassionate, 
the Merciful.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.920
Nay, I swear by the places of the stars

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.820
A mighty oath, if you but new it

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.360
That this is indeed a noble Qur’an,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.130
Which none may touch except the purified;

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.060
God the Most Mighty has told the truth.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.230
They say that...

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.160
...he who is in search and finds the right path...

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.600
the starts will no longer be needed 
since the sun will be enough.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.540
Do not dwell on the stars.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.400
I do have the Sun in my hands...

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.300
...if you want to see it.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.900
Which none may touch except the purified;

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.440
That is the Quran.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.840
But it does not state
what tomorrow will happen to you.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.500
For the eyes that can see...

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.530
...the secrets are Here,
as well as the secret of the secrets.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.460
The book you took just now is only
a drop from the Ocean called Quran.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.400
I never saw you before in Aleppo,
stranger. Are you from around here?

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.330
I am a poor traveler.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.530
I set off from the countries where
the sun sets to look for the country...

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.800
...where the sun will rise from.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.400
I’m the author of the book you were just given.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.260
What happened, sir?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.130
The man was Ibn Arabi.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.900
We should not be late.
People are waiting for us at the lodge.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.960
We will go by the stream,
you take the hills.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:41.620
Oh God, send your Mercy on Muhammad, 
the master of Arabs and Ajams...

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:56.920
And the greatest imam of precious Mecca, 
shining Medina, and al-Haram

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.380
It is for the sake of the 
greatest Prophet Muhammad,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:16.340
"God has taught man that which he knew not”

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:30.300
His origin descends from Adam

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:43.580
His honorable name is written in the place...

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.720
where the secrets of fate 
are kept by the ruby (ink) of the pen

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:09.280
He who is to intercede for the entire universe, said:

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:27.080
“Oh God, have mercy on my people.
Oh, my people!”

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.320
Then He; (God) called out:

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.020
“Oh, most venerable Prophet, 
I have accepted your intercession.”

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.780
“Oh, most venerable Prophet, 
I have accepted your intercession.”

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.720
“Enter our Heaven,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.540
no fear shall come upon you,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.720
nor shall you grieve or feel any pain.”

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:15.060
May prayers and peace be upon our 
Prophet Muhammad, his relatives, and his companions.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:29.760
Oh, intercessor (mediator) of the sinners…

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.460
Great God.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.030
Turgut, you carry on.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.930
Carry on.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.300
My Shahzada, carry on.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.930
You tactless people!
What is the meaning of this?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.800
How can you shoot
an arrow at Ertugrul Bey?

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.230
We do not know, Dogan.
Kurdoglu Bey gave a direct order.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.000
Surrender without a fight.
And the arrow was just a warning...

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.200
...otherwise I could have hit him
right in the neck.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.230
You talk too much! I will cut it
for you to take it back to Kurdoglu.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.060
Go back to our tribe.
Don’t force my hand.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.240
We don’t want to shed
the blood of our brothers as well.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.860
Nothing will happen to our brotherhood 
if you listen to us and go back to our tribe.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:01.020
I neither obey you nor Kurdoglu.
I only obey my forefather’s customs.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.320
I won’t give up on those who seek my help 
and shed the blood of my brothers...

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.900
even if Kurdoglu sends a thousand men!

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.680
Ertugrul Bey, I hope you did not face
another trouble because of us.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.800
I decided I’d rather be without sleep 
than having a nightmare.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.830
We put you in a bad situation but
we set off early as a precaution.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.800
You are right as well.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.860
A lion will be blamed for shedding blood 
if it goes hunting...

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.600
...and for being lazy if it sits down.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:45.120
Ertugrul Bey, when we left the tent,
Gundogdu Bey was in the tent alone.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.900
I worry that something 
might have happened to him.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.130
Do not worry.
My brother can overcome all difficulties.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.960
Those four have died.
There is only one way for you to survive.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.960
I will set you free if you tell me 
where Ertugrul is headed.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.500
Aleppo. They are headed to Aleppo.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.000
This much freedom is enough.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.360
Go to the castle, take the knights.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.400
We shall set a trap for them
on the Aleppo road.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.960
So he is taking the Shahzadas to Aleppo.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.900
Sister, what are you saying?

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.600
Sister, it is over now.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.800
Ertugrul will never come back.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.360
How can he not come back?
His tribe, his father is here, Gokce.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.300
-Do not worry about it.
-But, sister...

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.760
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.540
May you have a good morning, my girl.
Is Gundogdu inside?

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.880
He did not sleep all night.
He must be asleep.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.360
May you have a good morning, Gundogdu Bey.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.800
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.320
-What is the matter?
-Not good news.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.980
Come on.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.000
Wash your face, then we have to talk.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.340
Let us talk.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.700
Your young brother Dundar...

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.600
...came to me early in the morning.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.500
He wanted to say something
to Ertugrul but he did not listen.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.300
You did not listen to him either.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.230
When I saw him, he had turned pale 
out of fear.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.360
What happened? Why was he frightened?

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.830
Not good news.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.430
They found Baybora’s dead body with Yigit
at the Black River.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.500
-Baybora’s body?
-Yes.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.400
Who would kill him and why?

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.330
I don’t know. But my mad mind
races on and thinks that...

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.460
...they have lost control,
thinking the tribe’s Bey is gone.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.900
The only thing they did not have was
blood on their hands.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.260
Do not think like that,
would this tribe ever be without a Bey?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.260
Don’t worry. At the headquarters, they'll
learn that the Bey of the tribe is alive.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.100
Don't worry.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.230
My Bey, in order to get ahead of Ertugrul
we went up the trail at Kiziltepe.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.530
When our team did not arrive,
we got suspicious and went back.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.930
When we came here, they were all dead.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.600
Alpargu, bury them all
before anyone sees them.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.060
Whatever happens, don’t forget that
you have sworn obedience to Kurdoglu Bey.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.200
He is Suleyman Shah’s acting Bey.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.860
Then why are we coming here, Alpargu?

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.900
What business do we have
at the headquarters called by Gundogdu?

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.200
We came to give a lesson
to our Bey’s incompetent son.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.960
Be on the side of our Bey, no matter what.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.560
Kurdoglu Bey...

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.960
...Baybora’s place has been empty
for such a long time.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.500
We cannot see him in the headquarters.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.960
What happened?

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.800
Where is he?

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.560
I will say it before you.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.460
Last night he was found...

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.930
...at the banks of Black River,
stabbed to death.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.900
The very night Ertugrul came here 
and asked you about him.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.200
What do you implying, Gundogdu?
Be frank!

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.160
Be quiet, Alpargu. Keep your mouth shut.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.800
Your master will keep quiet as well...

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.600
...I shall be talking now.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.130
You pit the tribe against each other.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.130
You caused discord.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.400
You made people stone our guests’ tent.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.600
Tell me Kurdoglu...

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
-...is it in our rules to attack our guests?
-Come to the point, Gundogdu.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.830
Are you trying to accuse the person
you called uncle until yesterday?

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.830
Are you not the one who asked for the obedience of our Beys...

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.930
...by burying Suleyman Shah before he even died.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:14.830
In our customs, questioning belongs to
the headquarters and answering to the Bey.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.860
God help us.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.300
We are not going to learn
our customs from the children.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.000
We know what headquarter members
may ask and how to answer them.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.330
You want to be Bey
and call us to account...

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:36.060
...but you could not even steer
the caravan that was entrusted in you.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.000
You question me after Baybora’s death.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.560
But do you know what Ertugrul did?

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.460
Listen to me well, Beys of Kayi.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.100
Ertugrul...

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.130
...killed five warriors of our tribe.
-Watch it!

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.930
This is slander.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.930
Mother Hayme, Ertugrul would
never do such a thing.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.230
This shameless person
has lost control, my girl.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.830
The slanders are only
a reflection of his own dark heart.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.260
And thus...

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:35.530
...Gundogdu who left our Alps
to die in the caravan ambush...

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.260
...and Ertugrul who slayed our Alps
cannot challenge me at all!

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.900
Decency, Kurdoglu, decency!

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.400
Enough!

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:52.300
Aren’t you ashamed of
slandering our Bey’s sons?

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.530
Don’t you have no shame?

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.530
Silence, Deli Demir. Silence!

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.000
There is no lie in my words.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.930
God is my witness.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.960
Ertugrul abducted Suleyman Shah’s
guests last night.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.500
Their fate is unknown. In order to learn
what happened to our Bey’s guests...

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.260
...I sent some of my Alps after them.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.160
In the morning,
news of their death reached me.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.000
You are so keen to stir the tribe 
with your lies and tricks, Kurdoglu.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.300
Aren’t you ashamed to take advantage
of my father’s illness?

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.960
Gundogdu, do not talk like you don’t know.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.200
You set this up with your brother.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:02.900
You disobeyed the order and gave the
agreement to Ertugrul that was handed to you.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:08.230
One of us has to stay in the tribe
and fight against Kurdoglu’s doings.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.860
Kurdoglu?

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.830
He learned that Numan and his son are
Shahzadas. Now he is trying to convince...

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.030
...the Beys in the headquarters to migrate
somewhere in the Seljuk territory, not Aleppo.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.500
You are the one who is trying to take
advantage of your father’s illness.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.330
You are the one who sits in his place,
while he is laying in his bed.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.600
Thank God, the eyes of my blood brother are closed 
so he doesn’t witness all this.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.080
Let us go, Beys of Kayi.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.920
A headquarters not called by
Suleyman Shah...

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.860
...is not a place we want to be in.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.500
What will happen now, Gundogdu Bey?

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.960
The order given by Suleyman Shah
is still valid.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.200
Preparations for migration
to Aleppo shall continue.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:28.600
We will not give up on our Bey’s words
or his guests. With the help of God.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.230
We are almost out of the Seljuk territory,
we can rest our horses here for a while.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.330
-How is he, mother?
-The same, my son.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.860
Did you hear what was said?

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.260
I think we need to set your father off 
as soon as possible.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.940
You are right, mother.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:12.100
We need to take him to the range 
before he perishes on the road.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.860
You are right, Gundogdu Bey.
I can check and fix the old cart...

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.960
...for a more comfortable journey
for Suleyman Shah.

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:23.230
Thank you, Master.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.860
And this way we can help him heal 
if we make it to Aleppo as soon as possible.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.230
But I cannot come with you. You know that
the tribe is like a witch’s cauldron.

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:43.400
Don’t worry, Gundogdu Bey. I can take
Mother Hayme and Suleyman Shah...

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.260
...to Aleppo safe and sound.
We will leave early in the morning.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.030
If God permits.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.900
Look at Ertugrul.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.030
I would have never thought that
he would kill the tribe’s Alps.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.430
You have been my assistant for nothing
all these years, Alpargu.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.930
My Bey...

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.500
...this is a Crusader arrow.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.430
Bravo, Alpargu.
You start to understand slowly.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.860
-Brother Turgut?
-Yes, brave boy?

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.830
How are you related to
brother Bamsi and Dogan?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.930
They are my blood brothers.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.530
I have a blood brother as well now.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.400
Who is your blood brother?

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.230
Dundar.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.830
But you blood brothers
are always together...

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.060
...Dundar and I are separated.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.860
The world is not that big, Yigit.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.360
Mountains may not meet...

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.100
...but people can meet again.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.500
The hillside is quiet. There is no one
in sight. How was your side?

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.600
The downside is clear as well.
This is a secure place.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.060
Everywhere is clear, why are you frowning.
Because you couldn’t find an enemy?

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.060
No, this man called Afsin
is making me anxious.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.160
Do you know who he is?

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.500
I don’t know either
but it is not very important.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.500
Don’t tire your pea-sized brain out
with things like this.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.200
Your mind is not used to thinking.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.440
Look now, we are in the field
beside the water, right?

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.900
Shall we wrestle so that
I can crush you to the ground?

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.120
Alright. Alright but...

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.960
...do not cry when you lose!

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.240
Let me go! I said let me go!

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.160
Let me go!

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.030
What about you and sister Aykiz?

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.360
She is my sweetheart.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.330
Are brother Ertugrul and
my sister Halime sweethearts too?

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.830
Yigit Alp?

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.360
What are you saying?

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.700
-Get the dried meat from the saddlebag.
-But, sister.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.800
Go on.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.060
-But sister...
-Go on.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.860
I will send Ertugrul to you, my brother.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.200
Your soul will not be tormented anymore.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.330
Are you fine, my Shahzada?

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.400
Yes, thank you.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.800
I am listening to my inner voice.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.900
What does your inner voice tell you?

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.060
I think about my forefather Oguz.
He saw a dream, our Oguz Khan...

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.830
...and he pulled his golden bow
from sunrise to sunset...

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:39.200
...and said
this world is too small for two rulers...

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.060
...enough for one ruler.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.930
And our Great Bilge Khan said...

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.030
...as long as the blue sky
does not fall down...

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.160
...or as long as the great earth
does not split apart...

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.100
...no one can overrule your customs.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.560
Then my grandfather Tugrul Bey...

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.360
...after the Battle of Dandanaqan...

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.400
...called for the Great Council...

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.960
...and opened up
new horizons for our people.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.460
And sent this nation to the Land of the Romans.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.030
In the Lands of the Romans in Manzikert...

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.330
...Sultan Alparslan...

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.000
wore his shroud for a new world order
and turned these lands...

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.160
...into a state.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.300
Do you know what my inner voice says,
Ertugrul?

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.980
We need another hero who will unite...

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:53.180
...lead and set a new vision
for these people.
