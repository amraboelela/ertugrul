RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.060
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.530
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.500
For the men who died...

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.780
God is the Greatest.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
God is the Greatest.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020
God is the Greatest.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280
Peace be upon you and God’s blessings.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.320
Peace be upon you and God’s blessings.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.320
Our brothers ask for your
blessing one last time.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.860
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.100
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.160
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.230
If God permits,
they will forgive us as well.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.930
For our Prophet Muhammad’s intercession...

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.600
...for our brothers’ soul...

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.300
...for our tribe’s unity and abundance...

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.930
For God’s mercy...

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.930
...recite Al Fatiha prayer.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.360
My Beys...

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.830
My heroes...

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.200
Wise men of my tribe...

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.130
...I know what is in your hearts...

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.860
...we have the right for revenge
from this lowlife.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.500
He should not get away with the blood he
shed and the curses he got for cruelty.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.960
But...

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.300
...executing this lowlife is not for us.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.100
His sentence should be given
by Sultan Aladdin.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.530
Suleyman Shah...

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.800
...how many mothers are mourning now.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.660
They think about their loved ones
who died at the hands of Kara Toygar.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.040
What you are saying makes us even suffer more.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.920
You are so unaware! When did you see
our Bey make our tribe bow down in shame?

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.500
Our Bey knows what is best for all of us.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.800
My Beys...

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.830
...we have the right to blood,
that is a fact but...

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.530
...practicing eye for an eye
is not an honor for us.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.200
The sentence for collaborating with
the Crusaders and betraying the state...

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.200
...should be given by Sultan Aladdin.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.460
Does anyone have an objection?

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.400
Commander Sari Boru shall take Kara Toygar
to Konya and deliver him to the sultan.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.830
The lowlife dog will understand
before his last breath that...

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.100
...treachery would be punished
sooner or later.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.930
Commander, you are a lucky man.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.500
You will see this pig drowning
in his own blood.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.830
We have to set on the road
to Aleppo in two days.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.100
Are the preparations completed?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.160
We have packed everything, Bey. Only
the dismantling of the carpet workshop...

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.030
...and the tents are left.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.020
The herd has also set off, my Bey.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.020
I sent some trusted Alps
with the herders as well.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.520
Then the job of taking the agreement to
El Aziz and building the stables...

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.200
...and sheep pens shall be...

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.960
...yours, Gundogdu.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.130
Father, with your permission...

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.000
-Father?
-Suleyman!

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.230
Suleyman!

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.120
-My Bey?
-Father?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.100
I seek refuge in God from Satan, the Accursed one.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.940
In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.140
Ya Sin

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.460
By the wise Qur’an

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.680
Truly you are of those sent

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.920
On a straight path,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.840
A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.420
That you might warn a folk whose fathers 
were not warned, so they are heedless.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.740
Indeed, the word was proved true against the greater part of them, for they believe not.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:11:00.900
Surely, we have put on their necks yokes reaching unto the chins, so they are made stiff-necked.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.740
And We have set a bar before them 
and a bar behind them,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.860
and (thus) have covered them so that they see not.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.600
Now it is up to you.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.860
You will go to Sultan Aladdin
and tell him everything.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.400
You will tell him that Kayis...

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.300
...kidnapped the traitor Shahzadas
you were taking to Konya...

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:28.200
...then used their names to get support
from other Turkmen tribes for an uprising.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.230
They want to rise up
and overthrow Sultan Aladdin.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.360
I could not acknowledge such a thing,
so I set off again...

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.330
...to take the rebellious
Shahzadas to Konya.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.300
They ambushed me. Killed all my soldiers.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.260
My most trusted commander, Sari Boru.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.500
They cut his throat, right in front of me.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.960
You will take an army from
Sultan Aladdin and bring them here.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.530
Kayis will understand
why they call you the Fire of Wrath.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.830
Then you will return to Konya 
and become the right hand...

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.030
...of the sultan you have just saved.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.000
I did what I could do.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.160
Unfortunately, his fever is not going down.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.530
They only thing we can do now is pray.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.360
Our Bey...

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.400
...would like us to do our chores
and jobs whatever happens.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.530
We all know our jobs and chores.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.600
When he opens his eyes...

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.300
...he should see that all is done.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.300
We have a long road
ahead of us to Aleppo...

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.400
...but none of us shall give up.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.200
ALEPPO

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.160
Welcome back, my Sheikh.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.900
Thank you, my Pir's grandson.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.030
May God have his mercy over us.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.460
Your heavenly grandfather had said...

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.960
...“each bird flies with its kind.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.600
Eagles with eagles. Crows with crows.”

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.200
Aleppo has become very crowded.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.130
Eagles are at one gate
and crows on the other.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.890
They all have different wishes.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.060
Some are after their food, not caring
about whether it is lawful or not...

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:18.540
...others are after a post. They don't
care whether God has given consent or not.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.860
And when those plot against you, God (also) plots.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:31.460
-Without a doubt, God is the best of plotters!
-Dear God. Of course.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.000
Good news for you, Selcan Hatun.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.430
Your intuition was right.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:03.130
From now on you will not only live for
your husband, but for your son as well.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.240
A long journey awaits Ertugrul and us.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.660
We are impatient to leave...

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.740
...but this will be the hardest
journey I will be on.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.100
I know.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.380
Be my confidant, my comrade, Sultan.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.920
-If only things were different.
-If only.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.130
I heard that...

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.530
...Suleyman Shah is not well.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.800
They say he is sleeping and waiting for death!

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.560
They say he waits for
his time in his deathbed.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.230
We piled more problems over his troubles.
We became a big burden for him.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.260
May God help him.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.130
Amen.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.230
Suleyman Shah said that...

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:44.200
...Gundogdu Bey will be going to Aleppo.
She will take you there, Halime.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.000
Gundogdu Bey?

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.200
Do not forget to dismantle this.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.260
Tie them well.
We have a long road ahead of us.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.200
So you came, Kurdoglu.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.900
When you hear the things I am going
to say, you will be surprised.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.560
The identities of our valuable guests
who brought...

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.600
...nothing but dark clouds over our tribe
are revealed.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:48.600
Numan who claimed to be a trader
was actually a Seljuk Shahzada.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.460
But what is your intention
of telling me this news, Selcan Hatun?

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.860
I saw what you can do with
a piece of information, Kurdoglu.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.960
My father and uncle Kurdoglu
went on a hunt one day.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.230
They were both around our ages then.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.560
-Uncle Kurdoglu fell off his horse.
-Why? Did something happen to the horse?

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.500
The horse had startled because
there was a big bear in front of them.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.900
What did Kurdoglu do?

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.830
My uncle could not do anything
because his leg was broken.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.530
When that bear was about to
tear my uncle apart...

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.400
...my father came and
killed the bear with his spear.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.860
Your father is very brave.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.060
They became blood brothers then.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.000
Yigit, you will be going tomorrow.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.430
When you go, please don’t forget that
you have a brother in Kayi tribe.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.600
Let us go.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.330
Yigit...

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.030
...look.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.560
Run.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.320
Oh God, who has given Luqman al-Hakeem the secret...

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.060
...protect us from incurable troubles.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.240
They are upstairs.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.330
Welcome, Nasir.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.560
You called for me, sir.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:22.030
Go to El Aziz immediately and tell him to
stop Kayis from settling at our borders.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.360
-But, sir, Titus...
-I cannot waste time talking about...

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.600
...the stupid decisions Titus made.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.800
He is only a pawn
who thinks he is a vizier.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.960
It is very hard to dissuade
El Aziz from his decision.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.530
He really liked the Kayis.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.720
Is El Aziz's love for the Kayis so much...

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:54.060
...to take the risks of infecting 
whole Aleppo with plague?

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.830
Did you manage to find the person
who sent the spies to kill Ertugrul?

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:16.560
According to the information I have, the
Templars have mobilized all their spies.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.460
I am trying to uncover
their sources within the palace.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.500
Come, Nasir, come. Come.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.860
Sir, the problem is important,
I did not want to wait for the morning.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.460
Intelligence has been informing
about the plague in Anatolia.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:42.500
I wanted to be sure whether our potential
allies have been plagued or not.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.500
Sir, I know, you like Kayis very much.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.120
I also believe that they are cut out for 
in case of a Crusaders’ attack...

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.020
-But...
-But what, Nasir?

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.360
Sir, unfortunately
most of their livestock have perished.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.300
Don’t...

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.930
...reject them from our borders, Nasir.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.200
Do you understand? Don’t.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.860
When he brings the agreement,
I want to talk personally with Ertugrul.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.060
Come on now, Gundogdu.
All the Beys have gathered in the tent.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.960
Today is the day.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.030
Do not talk like
my father has died, Kurdoglu.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:50.200
You are the tribe’s son as much as
you are your father’s son, Gundogdu.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.460
Will you sit in your tent like
a woman while your tribe is in trouble?

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.400
As we move down to the plains from
the highlands the troubles shall cease...

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.400
...and my father will get well.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.900
I have nothing else to say, Kurdoglu.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.560
Do you know what you will face while going
down to the plains from the highlands?

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.800
What are you trying to say, uncle?

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.100
I am saying that...

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.200
...this path we are taking
is not wise, son.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.000
This is the headquarter’s decision
and my father’s order.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.100
This is my final word, Kurdoglu.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.060
Do you think that I want to be
the acting Bey...

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.800
...and to sit in the tent
under your father’s shadow?

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.800
Don’t you know me, Gundogdu?

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.330
Wasn’t it you who said your father is
too old to perform his Bey duties...

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.960
...and asked me to support you
to become the new Bey?

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.200
Didn’t I tell you that I would be
supporting you until the end?

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.300
What is your cause now?

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.030
I am an old man with only
a few years to live.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:01.260
I told you numerous times that the tribe
needs a brave, determined Bey like you.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:06.230
I would like you to trust me
until I save you from these problems...

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.060
...and make you a Bey in our new home.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.960
Come to the point, uncle.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.300
I have learned the real identity
the ominous guests Ertugrul brought here.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.800
I know that Numan and his son are from
the Seljuk dynasty, they are Shahzadas.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.560
Those people you were complaining about
are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:37.500
The man called Numan is a Shahzada and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.160
If we deliver them...

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.530
...the Sultan would award our tribe.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.860
We can settle in the best places in
Seljuk territory.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.930
What do you want from me, Kurdoglu?

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.130
Give up on Aleppo.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.900
Aleppo will be our doom.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.360
We should take them tonight...

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.360
...and deliver them
to the Sultan, Gundogdu.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.800
May God heal you for our sake and 
for the sake of Kayi tribe!

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.500
My Bey...

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.360
...we are ready for the ambush.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.200
You look surprised!

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.200
Alpargu, leave us.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:37.460
I was expecting you.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.600
But I was not expecting you, Gundogdu.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:49.230
Kurdoglu will go at night
to ambush a tent and kidnap a Shahzada...

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.100
...and I will miss this party.
How can this be?

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.980
You wanted them to leave yesterday...

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.440
...and today you are guarding their tent, huh?

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:06.560
Well, it’s you who is trying to be the tribe’s Bey 
by deceiving people with a high hand...

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.460
...so, let me guard the tents...

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.200
...uncle.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.900
There should be one, guarding the tribe...

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.160
...to keep it safe from dangerous people!

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.620
We wouldn’t want people just riding into the tribe swinging their swords.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.240
Now tell me, where did you learn
this Shahzada issue?

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.960
When I went to Kara Toygar
as a messenger, I put out feelers on him.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.060
I connected the dots.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.830
Why did you keep it a secret until now?

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:48.400
I did it for the same reason as Suleyman Shah 
who even hid it from his sons!

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.400
You are lying.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.160
You asked, I answered.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.460
Now, whoever brought you into doubt, 
go and question them!

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:14.360
The people you have been complaining about
are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:19.000
The man called Numan is a Shahzada and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.230
-Brother, I need to talk with you.
-Not now.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.430
-Brother!
-I said, not now, Dundar!

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.900
Gundogdu...

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.600
...is there something wrong?

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.900
Was it you who told Kurdoglu that
Numan and his son were Shahzadas, Hatun?

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.430
-What happened?
-Answer me. Did you tell him or not?

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.360
What Shahzada, Gundogdu?
What are you talking about?

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.430
What made you so angry?

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.830
Kurdoglu learned that
they are Shahzadas, Hatun.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.930
What did he do then?

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.530
I don’t know his intention
but he wanted to imprison them.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.400
-Where are the Shahzadas?
-They left with Ertugrul.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.100
I want you to take the agreement
to El Aziz, Ertugrul.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.460
But brother,
my father gave this duty to you.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.060
Very well, and I am giving it to you.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.040
We should do what we know best, Ertugrul.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.400
Don’t you always say...

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.180
let the headquarter be yours
and hunt mine?

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.560
-And you let them go? What are you up to?
-What is it to you?

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.830
-Did you tell him or not?
-I did not tell, Gundogdu.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.160
What business can I have with Kurdoglu?

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.230
Did Kurdoglu tell you
that he heard it from me?

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.800
He said that it was someone else.
But if you told him, Hatun...

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.130
...may God be my witness that...

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.100
You were not like this.
Something happened to you.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.600
Don’t you trust the woman
who is carrying your child in her womb?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.500
To your wife who is going to
give you a son?

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.430
My Bey, Ertugrul and his Alps have left.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.030
Round up the men you trust,
they should go after them.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.430
Tell them not to refrain from
shedding blood if needed.
