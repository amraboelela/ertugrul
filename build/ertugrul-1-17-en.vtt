00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.900
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.000
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.400
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.700
Be patient, my soul.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.760
Don’t expect a remedy to your suffering.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.860
Don’t throw yourself into a fire
and expect your lover to save you.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.160
Pearls of tears weep through
the mother of pearl of your eyes.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.840
Don’t expect anything from
the beloved with coral pearl lips.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.240
Come, do not rejoice...

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.560
...and cry, poor nightingale

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.020
Don’t expect anything from
the beloved with a mouth like the rose garden.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.220
My Esma? My beautiful eyed and debonair woman...

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.740
Why are you so down?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.160
What is it that bothers you?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.280
Didn’t you like the poem?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.400
Is it possible for me to not like a poem
from that enchanting voice of yours?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.200
Is it possible for me to fall
into the darkness...

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.380
...while you shine my night by being here?

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.500
Don’t you know how much I dream of you and 
wait for the time that I will come together with you?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.480
So?

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.200
What is the trouble that bothers you then? 
Tell me.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.140
I’m just keeping my silence being afraid of 
exceeding my authority, my Sultan.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.120
My Esma.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.260
Tell me.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.040
-Sahabeddin.
-I don’t understand. Sahabeddin?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.860
Did he do something to you?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.620
-Did he...
-No, not like that.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.200
I am only a loyal and
a trusted servant in his eyes.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.840
But this is my fear.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.920
I fear that I might have sinned
because of him, my Sultan.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.680
He trusts me more than anyone else.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.900
All the secrets he hides from others,
he shares with me.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.100
He didn’t even hide
the assassin from me, my Sultan.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.400
I was taking food to him every day.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.340
But today...

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.680
...the man...

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.860
...died with foam
coming out of his mouth.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.120
I think he was poisoned, my Sultan.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.820
Why didn’t you tell me, Esma?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.100
I was afraid.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.840
-And I am still afraid.
-What are you afraid of?

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.360
If Sahabeddin...

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.000
...poisoned that man with
the food I took there...

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.900
What if I gave that poison...

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.900
...and sinned by killing him?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.300
It is alright, do not worry.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.030
My Sultan...

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.300
...I knew that he was not an
innocent man...

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.100
...but why didn’t he punish him himself?

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.240
Why did he hide it from me?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.240
I have not even harmed
an ant until this day.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.700
-You know my heart.
-Alright.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.060
-I can’t even step on an ant.
-It is alright.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.820
May God forgive me.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.660
What if I sinned and...

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.980
...killed him?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.340
It is alright. Do not worry.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.000
It is over.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.020
Do not worry.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.200
It is over.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.920
Do not worry.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.930
My daughter...

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.860
...looks like the moon.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.800
Her eyebrows are like...

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.960
...a stretched bow.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.030
When she waves her hair...

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.930
...she looks like a pony with a long mare.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.030
There will be a feast soon...

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:26.030
...her face will shine up the room.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.200
She is just like a son...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.800
...who will be a valiant Bey.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.740
Hayme?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.420
Hayme?

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.700
Mother Hayme? Mother Hayme, wake up.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.940
-What happened, my girl?
-Do now panic, mother, it is good news.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.860
Suleyman Shah called your name.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.840
My Bey? My Bey?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.280
My Bey, I am here.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.220
-Did he say anything else?
-No, mother.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.960
He only said your name.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.720
My girl, may God bless you.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.400
You have been torn apart here with us.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.760
You did not stay with your sister...

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.480
...you set on the road with us.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.580
Please do not say that, mother Hayme.
I see Suleyman Shah as my father as well.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.260
He has every right over me and my sister.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.480
Moreover...

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.480
...I will be his bride soon.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.980
I will call him father.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.240
I pray to God every time I see you two.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.740
I pray to God for a life like
yours for Ertugrul and me.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.120
When I learned that you found me suitable
for Ertugrul and wanted me as a bride...

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.360
...I was honored.
-Gokce.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.780
It is late now.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.620
You are very tired.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.320
Go and sleep, my girl.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.400
I am sorry, mother Hayme.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.220
I was tactless.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.140
-I only...
-Gokce.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.360
Look, my girl. This is a matter of fate.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.860
It’s not only up to my will.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.220
Fate is what God has written for us.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.660
Do you understand?

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.820
Go on, go, and rest for a bit. Come on.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.740
Do not fear, my Shahzada.
You will not be subjected to this.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.160
You come from noble blood.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.940
Let my Turgut Aga go.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.000
Royal people can’t grieve 
for their slaves’ destiny.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.040
They can only be worried about their purposes.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.900
You cowards!
Kill me without playing around!

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.560
Your end will not be so easy, Turkmen.
You will beg...

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.340
...but you will live.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.780
In a way I want you to.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.200
I only have one life in which I trust my God.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.920
I’m not afraid of you.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.660
Sometimes people even afraid
of themselves.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:06.460
If they don’t fear for themselves, they
fear for the lives of their loved ones.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.320
Isn’t that so, Giovanni?

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.000
Oh, my brave son…

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.740
Don’t be confident about 
your courage and youngness.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.600
It’s not about being a hero.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.440
There is no one here
other than God who can hear you.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.340
Dear God...

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.260
...be my side and help me.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.060
Each moment you feel desperate, 
remember that God is the Greatest.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:08.320
Repeat to yourself that He is the one who feeds 
your hunger whenever you are in need.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.030
You are here with God.
Do not forget this.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.400
And be aware of the fact that you are here, 
in the Madrasa al-Yusufiyya.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.220
If you are to lose your faith 
and be on your own...

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.380
...then will they turn you into a man 
who is even afraid of himself.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:17.600
I will succeed with this miserable Turk
where I failed with Giovanni.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.740
How long do you think it will take
for him to give in, sir?

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.200
According to the methods in this book,
he can only resist for 40 days.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.920
And then?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.140
I was not aware of your arrival,
dear Thomas.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.600
You are like the angel of death.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.920
You showed up suddenly once again.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.160
How are our guests?

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.900
They are resting in their quarters.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.100
Are you going to be victorious
through the mice you put in dungeons?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.060
Even I can barely understand you.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.000
Dear Thomas...

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.440
...I do not stick my nose
in your business in Europe.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.760
And you should not dwell
in the matters here.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.220
That is your decision. I am merely
trying to convince our Holy Father...

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.960
...to a new Crusade.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:31.760
I will find Ibn Arabi’s chest and
the sacred relics inside sooner or later.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.820
This is a promise and
Lord's Son shall be my witness.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.980
But I will not do it
with knights like Titus.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.320
I will do it through people who think
they are still Turks but...

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.780
...I shall decide on what they shall be.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.860
How will you accomplish this?

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.400
With an old Asian legend.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.400
We will soon see the fruits of our labour.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.320
The Vizier is as good as dead
for El Aziz now. Aleppo will remember...

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.800
...Sahabeddin as a traitor
who collaborated with the Crusaders.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:31.620
And I will reveal this betrayal and become
His Highness Ameer’ s only trusted aide.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.900
What about Ertugrul?

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.360
I mean Kayis...

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.340
...and their territory?

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.820
It will be resolved today, right?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.840
Don’t you worry about it. El Aziz is
a puppet, which I hold the strings now.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.940
Ertugrul will leave that palace
as a man who lost everything.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.100
No, my friend. You are mistaken.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.420
Ertugrul will understand
what he lost when he meets us.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.320
I seek refuge in God from Satan, the Accursed one.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.680
In the name of God, the Compassionate, 
the Merciful.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.200
Ya Sin 
By the wise Qur’an

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.220
Ertugrul?

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.320
Truly you are of those sent…

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.140
Great God!

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.030
Ertugrul! Watch out!

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.900
Ertugrul! Watch out!

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.830
Thank God. You are better now.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.600
Father?

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.830
Father, where is Yigit?

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.960
Did something happen to Yigit,
where is my brother?

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.100
No, my dear girl. Nothing happened to him.
He is with the Alps.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.900
Calm down, your wound might
start to bleed.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.860
Where are we, father?

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.960
We reached Aleppo, my girl.
We are in a secure place.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.600
Father, why is Yigit not with us?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.330
I want to see my brother.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.860
You will see him tomorrow, my girl.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.920
Sleep now. You should sleep.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.280
Sleep and rest.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.800
Dear God...

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.080
...spare these innocents.
Bring Yigit to us safe and sound.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.200
The servant told the truth.
The man is indeed poisoned, your highness Ameer.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.080
Akcakoca, what kind of a disaster
is this plague?

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.860
Didn’t we kill all those sheep
to fend it off?

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.460
We did, my Bey. We did but...

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.600
...this is a child’s doing. She couldn’t
sacrifice her lamb and hid it.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.100
We set on the road tomorrow.
What will happen to these people?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.200
My Bey, there is nothing we can do for them.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.030
In a few days, they will...

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.160
Will we leave them here?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.900
I will stay with them.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.460
Bey, I know there is nothing I can do...

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.840
...but I can relieve their pain
for a while.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.940
Akcakoca...

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.180
...there are some who don’t want to
migrate. I need to talk to them.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.340
If they stay here, it would be a disaster.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.060
They need to know that no matter what.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.500
May God make it easy for you.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.060
Your highness Ameer.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.200
I deliver you the greetings of Kayi...

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.760
...and the gratitude of my father Suleyman Shah 
for the new land.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.500
There have been rumors...

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.800
...about your tribe.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.240
Is there anything you would like 
to tell me Ertugrul?

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.360
I talked with your Vizier
Sahabeddin Tugrul as well...

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.880
...these rumors are lies.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.100
Templars who are not fond of the alliance
between us attacked our tribe.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.760
Those who tried to spread disease
in our tribe and the people...

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.960
...who spread these rumors are the same.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.580
You are lying, Ertugrul.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.480
The enemy who you think is beyond your
borders are actually inside your palace.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.260
You are not aware.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.860
Your highness Ameer...

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.260
What are you doing here, Nasir?

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.880
Where is His Highness Ameer?

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.960
Guards.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.820
How dare you?

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.640
Inform El Aziz immediately.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.040
Calm down, Vizier.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.420
This is actually the order of
His Highness Ameer.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.800
He personally wants to question you.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.500
Is Kurdoglu not here?

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.740
I do not know where he is, my Bey.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.400
He told me to pack his belongings
and make them ready for the caravan.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.040
He is to solve an important matter
and join the caravan later.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.920
He will join the caravan you say.
So Kurdoglu Bey will migrate with us.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.740
Alpargu, tell me. Your Bey does not
do anything without informing you.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.220
I really do not know, my Bey.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.020
He only said that it was
about Suleyman Shah...

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.200
...that was all.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.440
The cart shook him up more than
we expected, mother Hayme.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.940
You are right, Master Demir.
It is good that we stopped to rest.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.920
The horses will have a chance to
rest as well.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.320
May God give him health,
so that he can walk while entering Aleppo.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.460
If God permits.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200
-Hayme.
-My Bey!

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.500
My Bey!

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.560
My Bey?

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.140
Come on, my girl.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.300
Give our Bey some space 
to have some fresh air.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.020
Kurdoglu.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.900
Tell me, why is the Ameer not coming?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.460
I really do not know why His Highness
is acting like this, my Vizier.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.420
I have insisted repeatedly
but he did not want to talk.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.160
He just assured you...

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.640
...of an absolute fair hearing...

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:18.000
...and that will be under my responsibility.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.040
You may leave, Nasir.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.300
Dear God...

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.400
...I am ready to be hurt,
but don’t let the justice be hurt.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.200
Do not give the tyrants an opportunity.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.900
Oh, Mighty God, the tyrants shall kill me 
if they want...

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.100
...but your order which will exalt your name...

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.820
...shall continue forever.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.900
Turkmen valiant.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.940
Ertugrul Bey.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.920
You won’t regret it if you turn around.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:24.300
Effendi Titus says: “The eagle is in
the cage, now it is the wolf’s turn.”

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.330
Great God!

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.440
Tell me? Whose dog are you?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.120
Where is my brother?
Where is the Shahzada?

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.760
Speak!

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.960
It won’t be so easy this time!

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:22.860
Hamza...

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.600
...are the Alps ready for
the security of the migration route?

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.900
They are ready, my Bey.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.060
Ilyas Fakih...

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.780
...did you talk with the families of
the people who have to stay behind...

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.440
...because of this plague?

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.280
I did, my Bey.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.980
I tried to comfort them but it is hard.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.260
May God never test anyone
with their children.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.420
And if He does, may He give them the patience 
of Prophet Ayub.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.620
Amen.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.200
Akcakoca...

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.060
...would this plague spread outside
the confinement?

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.280
My Bey, these things cannot be known
by looking from the outside...

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.240
...but it seems that this plague
is not spreading outside.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.260
If you see it fit as well...

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.260
...there is nothing else holding us back
from the journey.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.440
I see it fit. We shall set off.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.980
Then...

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.360
...for our loved ones in the graves
and for our babies in their cots...

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.000
...as an Oguz tribe,
we shall walk to our new homeland.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.340
The tribe is in enough turmoil as it is,
why do you summon me here?

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.180
I know...

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.020
...Kurdoglu did not manage to kill
Suleyman Shah.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.540
Do not feel sorrow, Selcan. It is soon.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.380
You shall revenge the death of
your father Alpsungur.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.300
Suleyman Shah’s death
will be from your hands.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.460
But first, there is another trouble
you need to get rid of.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.780
-What trouble is that?
-Plague!

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.900
The whole tribe shall be infected soon.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.020
You have to save yourself
and your son from this disease.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.340
The ill are isolated. The animals
are burnt! What are you saying?

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.840
It is not over yet.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.860
This evil shall take many more lives.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.820
This evil does not have a remedy.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.140
There is nothing else but confinement.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.100
I do have a cure.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.720
You should drink this every day.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.080
It will protect you, your husband
and most importantly...

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.920
...your son from this evil.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.700
What happened?
What were you doing here, Kurdoglu?

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.060
I rode my horse without rest
for the safety of our Bey.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.280
Thank God, I made it in time.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.800
My blood brother, my life brother.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.240
Was it just a feeling, Kurdoglu?

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.760
How did you know that something
like this might happen to our Bey?

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.360
Mother Hayme, this dog called
Bozok came to me a few days ago...

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.920
...asking me about the
death of his father.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.260
He heard Gundogdu accusing me
in the headquarters.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.500
He saw me as the killer of his father.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.700
He put a knife at my throat.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.320
I still pitied him thinking that he is in
deep sorrow, he was a boy of this tribe...

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.220
...and forgave this impudence.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:43.720
But when Gundogdu mentioned that
the Bey’s tent was cut with a knife...

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.340
...God forbid,
implied that he was attacked...

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.180
...I thought about how some people might
have whispered something in his ear.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:01.040
Then I could not stay back, so I got on
my horse and rode until it was exhausted.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.920
What happened to my tribe in two days?

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.160
Traitors have embarked, Alps have
separated and everything has fallen apart.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.560
ALEPPO

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.840
You have not even blinked an eye
the whole night.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.780
I have caused great distress
with the news I gave you.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.900
You are not the reason for the matter.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.340
Besides, thanks to you we have found out 
the one who was conniving against me.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.220
I've served our Vizier for years,
he is a very good man.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:47.060
He was on the right path for years but...
-But the important thing is...

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.260
...not to be on the righteous path but
not to stray for even for a second.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.740
Alright, Sahabeddin Tugrul
has served our state well for years...

00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:00.220
...but this does not mean that we shall
turn a blind eye on the things he did.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.240
Because of the things I shared, I feel
responsible for the fate of your uncle.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.260
Sahabeddin Tugrul’s fate shall be
whatever he deserves.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.000
I said that whoever the traitor it is 
that has colluded with the Templars...

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.540
...I would hang him of the bastions of the tower.
