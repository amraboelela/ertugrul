RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.000
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.400
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.030
Thank you, despite everything, Kurdoglu.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.260
What if you were late?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.340
God has spared our Bey’s life to us ,
Deli Demir. The rest is not important.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.520
Well?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.860
What will you do now?
Will you come with us to Aleppo?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.800
No, I have to return. I cannot leave
the tribe alone in a migration journey.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.560
You are with our Shah, Deli Demir.
I know he is in good hands.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.500
Thank you.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.130
See you in Aleppo.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.960
This is Turgut’s axe!

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.200
And this is Shahzada’s necklace.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.100
Why do you have them, my Bey?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.930
Sit down.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.100
I will tell you everything.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.860
Amanos Mountains
Templars Castle

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.900
Yigit...

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.140
...do not let yourself down.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.120
Patience is bitter but its fruit is sweet.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.600
Alright, my lad?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.460
I am fine, Turgut Aga.
I am only a bit tired.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.500
That’s my lad!

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.100
Why did you chain up the Shahzada? 
Unchain him now.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.360
My Shahzada, your cap.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.030
Have some water.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.430
These crass savages have been tactless.
Having a Shahzada like you...

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.060
...breath the same air
with a shepherd is shameful.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.860
Would you like me to wash your face,
my Shahzada?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.560
I am Cardinal Thomas.
I come from the Papacy.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.230
I am always ready to assist you.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.600
I couldn’t sleep a wink because of the cruelty 
that those miserable men deemed proper for you.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.260
I have arranged a special room for you.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.400
I would be very pleased to host you and serve you...

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.880
...as much as I can befittingly for your royal blood.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.900
What about Turgut Aga?

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.180
Do not worry about him.
They will take good care of him.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.240
Shall we go, my Shahzada? Please.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.020
But...

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.120
...we have another big trouble
awaiting us.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.260
It is obvious that the things I told
Sahabeddin has not been heard by El Aziz.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.920
Today El Aziz,
tore off the agreement saying that...

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.540
...there is a plague in our tribe.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.040
This means that the caravans
don’t have a home to migrate to.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.960
Aleppo! Aleppo! May the ground split
and take you in, Aleppo!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.140
This is not the time to cry and frown.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.440
I understand that Sahabeddin fell victim
to a plot of the Templars.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.400
Otherwise, he would not have left me
alone in that palace no matter what.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.900
What do you propose, Ertugrul Bey?
What is on your mind?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.940
We have to learn
what happened to Sahabeddin.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.280
The vizier is the only person
who can help us reach Yigit and Turgut...

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.860
...as well as solve
this issue of our homeland.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.580
We cannot leave him to the mercy of
the Crusader infidels.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.100
Where are we going?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.160
We are going to watch a ceremony where
youngsters like you turn to real heroes.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.080
Father...

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.480
...Son...

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.940
...and The Holy Spirit.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.040
Father...

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.060
...Son...

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.860
...and The Holy Spirit.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.260
Have they become Alps now?

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.830
They have become invincible warriors,
more powerful and braver than the Alps.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.960
My governess...

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.600
...I am really worried about my uncle.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.680
Can he be in some sort of trouble?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.020
You are not hiding anything
from me, are you?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.100
My beautiful girl,
when did I ever hide anything from you?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.080
Do not worry. I sent the maids.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.900
We will get good news from
our vizier soon, if God permits.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.140
If God permits, governess.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.540
Look, whatever the news,
you shall tell me the truth. Promise me.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.320
Leila, do not worry.
I told you that I would.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.920
Promise me, governess.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.240
God give me patience. Alright. I promise.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.220
Do not be sad, Esma.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.440
We set out a trap but could not succeed.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.320
I did not realize that the infidels were
within us and they held my nephew...

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.560
...in their hands.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.420
Who do you suspect, my Effendi?

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.100
I did not consider him at first but...

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.480
...Nasir.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.600
Do not be scared. Do not be afraid.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:36.440
My brave Esma. There is no one but you 
that I can trust in this palace.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.400
What can I do for you, my Effendi?

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.800
Just order.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.940
You need to find someone
and bring him here to me.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.580
His name is Ertugrul.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.060
My uncle.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.180
Did she bring the news?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.020
Calm down, Leila. You will get ill.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.260
I am calm, governess. You promised me.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.880
You shall tell me straight up.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.040
Is my uncle well?

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.300
Vizier Sahabeddin has been arrested.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.000
He will stand a trial.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.860
Who did this and why?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.900
Leila, calm down.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.160
Your brother.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.520
Your uncle was arrested on
the orders of your brother Ameer El Aziz.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.700
Leila, Leila.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.160
You need to be calm. Come and sit here.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.440
Come on, my girl.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.100
Calm down. You need to be calm.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.280
Brother. I have to see my brother.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.840
Governess, I have to save my uncle.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.040
Do I understand you correctly?

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.220
This man called you beardless...

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.140
...and you got angry.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.840
Yes, your highness.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.200
But you are a beardless man.
Why do you get angry?

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.780
Anyway, you tell me.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.140
-Your highness, this beardless man came...
-That is not appropriate.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.440
In my presence, in the presence of
Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz...

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.030
...you shall both watch your manners.
Now talk.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.040
My Effendi, this man came and...

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.240
...plucked my beard, Efendi.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.960
Is that all?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.980
-Nasir.
-Yes, your highness?

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.900
Take them both to the dungeon.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.700
They shall stay in the dungeon
until the beardless man grows a beard.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.340
When the beardless man grows a beard,
the man whose beard was plucked...

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.340
...shall pluck the beard of the beardless man
to exercise the right to eye for an eye.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.300
And this problem shall be solved.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.000
-Let me go, your highness!
-Let me go! I beg you, let me go!

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.860
-Please spare us.
-Let me go! Have mercy on us!

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.030
Nasir? Are these real?

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.500
Or did you arrange
this visit day to entertain me?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.820
Please know that I have no contribution
at all, your highness.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.720
Your subjects came to take refuge
in your justice.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.100
My dear Nasir...

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.320
...why didn’t you tell me that
these state issues are so boring.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.920
Your highness.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.260
Leila Sultan.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.200
I do not understand.
What happened to Leila Sultan?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.200
She is not well. They're waiting for you.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.930
I have just seen Sahabeddin.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.130
He suspects you.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.330
Peace be upon you.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.300
My dear Afsin Bey.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.760
When they said that they saw you in the
streets of Aleppo, I did not believe them.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.360
So the youngsters realized that
I was following them.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.400
You raised them well.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.420
But I am surprised. Is there anyone
left who knows me?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.920
Please.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.860
Your fame precedes you, Afsin Bey.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.120
And the ones who don’t know,
we tell what a valiant man you are.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.320
Do not say that.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.200
But we used to commemorate you 
as a hero who was martyred.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.060
But I see that you are still alive. 
We were just telling some legends then.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.980
Is there any news about
the wise man in Ahlat, Aykutluk.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.040
It’s been a long time since I visited Ahlat.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.800
But the news we received is not nice.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.060
They say that the path taken
by the Seljuk dynasty is not right.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.200
Taking Sultan Aladdin from the Konya
palace and burning down the rest...

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.440
...would not be a sin, they say.
I do not know what will happen.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.300
It’s thought that it gets darker and darker 
when a cloud covers the crescent, Aykutluk.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.200
But it all needs a wind.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.320
The crescent shall shine again,
you can rest assured about that.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.720
Anyway, I want something else from you.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.140
Listen to me carefully.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.660
Whisper everyone in the streets of Aleppo.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.840
We need to learn
the fate of Vizier Sahabeddin.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.960
Thank you.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.460
Leila? My sister?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.900
Brother, where is our uncle?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.530
The starry night of Aleppo, Leila.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.130
Why do you worry, my dear sister?

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.600
He hasn’t been visiting me for days.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.360
He never neglected me before.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.000
Are the things I heard true?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.860
My Leila.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.560
The ache of my heart.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.980
Why are you worried about my uncle?

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.620
He is busy with state affairs. 
He will visit you soon.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.820
Tell me the truth, brother!
Are the things I heard true?

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.860
Is my uncle in prison?

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.400
When a slight breeze passes,
you tremble like a dry leaf.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.040
Your innocent heart cannot bear
the ugliness of the world.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.060
You would be bedridden
like a wilting rose.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.240
My precious sister...

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.360
...do not worry about our uncle.
-Brother. Is it true?

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.600
Our uncle Sahabeddin...

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.100
...engaged in things not befitting to him.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.100
Unfortunately,
what you heard is true, my sister.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.120
I do not believe that.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.800
How can you believe such a thing?

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.860
Our uncle would never attempt a bad thing.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.000
You are mistaken, my innocent sister.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.830
Our precious uncle...

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.960
...our wise vizier...

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.930
...collaborated with the killers
of our father, the Knights Templar.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.930
Leila, Leila.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.600
Leila.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.330
Leila! Leila!

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.800
I told your request to our people,
Afsin Bey. We will hear something soon.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.240
Shall we drink some sherbet
and rest until then?

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.800
Ertugrul?

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.360
Tell me, my Sultan.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.360
Do not worry about me.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.020
I will be fine.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.760
I know.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.340
But it hurts me when I see you in pain.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.800
You risked your own life to save me.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
What if something happened to you?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.880
But it did not. I am fine.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.460
When I opened my heart to you that day...

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.460
...you denied it. You are ready to
sacrifice yourself but...

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.100
...you refrain from
telling me what is in your heart.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.280
When a person knows that she cannot 
come together with her earthly love...

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.460
...then she wishes to come together 
with her divine love.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.100
Ertugrul you always told me the truth.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.030
I beg you not to hide
the truth from me now.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.130
I know it is not a good sign
that they are so delayed.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.300
Is there any news about Yigit and Turgut,
Ertugrul?

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.440
-Yes.
-Tell me the truth, Ertugrul.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.160
Did something happen to my brother?

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.460
The Templars...

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.340
...took them as prisoners.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.800
Don’t.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.140
Yigit must be devastated. Ertugrul...

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.160
Ertugrul, I beg you, save Yigit.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.220
I promise you, Halime.
I will bring your brother back to you.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.900
Hatun.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.120
We will cause a bit of discomfort...

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.980
...but considering the long time 
we will spend together...

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.940
...it’s best to keep your claws under control.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.300
-Where did you take the boy?
-Don’t you worry about him.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.880
You can rest assured that
we will look after him very well.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.060
He is an innocent boy.
What do you want from him?

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.540
Do whatever you want to do to me!

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.580
Why do you think that we treat him badly?

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.080
Cardinal Thomas who came here
is looking after him.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.160
You should have seen them while
they were watching the knights.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:06.260
Our little prince had a glitter, 
like Jesus’s poor warriors in his eyes.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.180
Welcome, my princess.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.900
Where is Elanora?

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.480
Why didn’t my sister come out to greet me?

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.900
Your highness, Ustad is waiting for you.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.000
He shall inform you about
this matter as well.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.330
Isadora!

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.930
My dear niece.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.900
You are here at last.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.400
I missed you very much, dear uncle.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.800
But my sweet sister is still
nowhere to be seen.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.000
Didn’t she miss me?

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.400
But she was urging me to come as soon as
possible in the letter she wrote to me.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.830
Where is Elanora, uncle?

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.360
-Governess?
-I am here, Leila.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.440
Close the curtains, governess.
There is too much light inside.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.440
My dear girl...

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.700
...if you could get up and walk a bit,
if you could eat something...

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.660
...you would regain your strength.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.540
You haven't eaten all day.
I am really worried about you, Leila.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.360
Close the curtains, governess.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.880
Is there any news, Afsin Bey?

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.760
What is his situation?

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.920
The news is not very good, Ertugrul Bey.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.100
Sahabeddin Tugrul has been arrested.
He is in the dungeons of Aleppo.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.540
What is the reason?

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.120
What is he accused of?

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.980
The accusation is not known, Ertugrul Bey.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.520
But yesterday Chief of Guard Nasir
and Melik El Aziz were seen...

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.580
...taking something out.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.360
There was a maid from
the palace with them as well.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.300
It might be something to do
with the vizier.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.860
Are you better now, Isadora?

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.540
How did it happen, uncle?

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.980
How did my beautiful sister die?

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.460
You know that...

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.900
...Elanora never accepted
his father’s death.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.340
But she was getting more obsessed 
with this idea recently.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.120
Maybe she mentioned this to you
in her letters.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.360
Mad girl.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.260
She had this mad idea that your father 
was being held in the dungeon.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:05.300
She was insistent on going there 
and made ridiculous excuses.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:11.300
But she was stubborn to see that 
the dungeons were very dangerous for her.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.000
I forbid her to go there.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.100
But...

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.900
...a day when I was not in the castle...

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.480
Did she go down the dungeon?

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.880
One of the ferocious convicts...

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.900
...in the hope of that he might escape...

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.860
...killed our innocent Elanora.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.420
-Is that convict still alive?
-No.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:50.300
He was executed,
just like the guards who let her go in.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.960
Elanora’s death was avenged
in a suitable manner.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.000
She is obedient, my Effendi.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.180
But she is clever too.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.060
One of the most beautiful girls
we have, my Effendi.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.860
-How is this one?
-She can stay.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.940
Yes, a pure beauty.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.320
Words are not enough
to describe her beauty.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.360
She is intelligent, skillful, educated.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.280
She has a beautiful voice as well.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.620
She can sing, recite poems
and dances well.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.440
Anyone watching her is captivated by her.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.560
You can arrange the rest.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.800
You know how this axe is made, right?

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.960
Yes.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.100
I know it well.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:42.340
A bunch of steel is forged to 
become an axe after a long process.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.740
And...

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.500
...do you know how a miner makes the ore 
and a leatherman makes leather?

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.860
Without that difficult process, 
the piece of leather you are wearing...

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.700
...would be nothing but some dirt.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:10.100
If it wasn’t burned in fire, the mine of the sword would not be different from the stone in the mountains.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.820
And you, Ertugrul...

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.220
...do you know what would happen 
if you weren’t tested?

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.200
It’s not only about my test.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.840
My friends,
my battle comrades, my family...

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.020
...my tribe that trusts me.
The vizier who wanted to help me.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.620
They are all in great difficulties
because of me.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.860
The pain caused by this
is burning my soul.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.880
Existence is a school, son.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.280
Everyone is a student.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.400
And God is the only Teacher.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.260
He reveals His characters in order to test us.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.960
However, suffering and grief...

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.280
...and also the trouble and mercy 
come from Him.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.280
Everyone has their own test.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:15.040
We need to be the ones who pass the test 
by fighting themselves, son.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.880
Then you become the greatest warrior
and the greatest hero.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.640
Is it also a part of the test to wait 
without doing nothing?

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.980
God likes reliance on Him, son, 
but not unwariness.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.900
If your brother is in difficulty...

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.220
...searching for the ways to save him 
from there...

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.660
...without forgetting the existence of God; 
that means reliance on God.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.500
Come on, get up.
The test of a valiant is not easy.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.040
And a valiant should not stop.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.560
Her room.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.620
-If you don’t want to stay here...
-On the contrary, I want to stay here.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.640
You are very tired.
Rest well tonight, Isadora.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.080
Good night, my girl.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.720
Good night.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.400
My Bey...

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.160
...I am the private maid of
Vizier Sahabeddin Tugrul.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.800
My name is Esma, he sent me here.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.880
How can I be sure that Sahabeddin sent you?

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.960
He told me to say “a man’s word is said
directly to a man’s face” and that...

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.660
...you would know, my Bey.
He wants to speak with you, face to face.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.500
All state matters are left to you,
your highness.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.600
And I thought that you have
a right to enjoy life a bit.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.800
I hope I didn’t exceed my authority.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.860
God is the Greatest.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.820
How will you take me in?

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.780
There is a secret passage that goes
to the dungeons. My vizier told me.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.560
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.
