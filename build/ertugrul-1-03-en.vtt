00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.030
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.600
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.130
Father?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.560
-Are you fine? Do you have any pain?
-Do not worry.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.800
I am awake now. I will be up in no time.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.430
Thank God.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.230
Get well soon.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.260
If you need anything Yigit can inform us.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.130
Ertugrul. Yigit told me everything.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.260
You and the people who raised
you are valiant people.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.460
You saved and protected us.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.430
We did what our customs order us to do.
There is no debt for that.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.900
The people in these lands have long
forgotten their customs.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.030
God must love us since we
stumbled across you.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.600
Please don’t say that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.330
I should go. And you should rest.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.200
Listen to me carefully, Halime.
Find us some horses immediately.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.230
Get prepared with your brother.
Don’t let anyone get suspicious.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100
What is happening, father?
What will we do?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.260
We are going.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.000
Halime, there is no other way.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.100
If we stay for one more day,
we would endanger their lives as well.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.000
I am going to the stable.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.300
Right before the headquarters,
where is this coming from, Gundogdu?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.930
I am going to look at
the new horse they brought.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.460
And you can start preparing
for the Aleppo journey.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.860
I can make everything ready but...

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.830
...is it confirmed that
you will be going to Aleppo?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.260
Don’t say that.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.230
I was the one who put forth
the idea at the headquarters.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.300
It is my right to be the envoy.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.530
-Of course but...
-Of course but what?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.360
Why are you so restless this morning, Selcan?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.300
I’m not sure if I should feel sorry
that you are going...

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.830
...or worry that you will get offended
if my father doesn’t let you go.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.400
Of course, he will send me.
Who else can he send?

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.800
Hatun, look, if you are feeling sad
that I will be going...

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.460
...during the time I go and come back,
you can greet me with two lives.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.800
When you are dealing with the horses in
the stable and me preparing you...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.900
...provisions for the journey, you'd be
waiting for a very long time, Gundogdu.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.400
I can check the horses after
the headquarters then.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.960
My Bey, do we have permission?

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.030
Come in, Hamza, come in.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.430
-What happened?
-My Bey, Suleyman Shah wants to see you.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.260
In the name of God. In the name of God.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.860
In the name of God.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.600
In the name of God.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.030
I have decided that...

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.830
...Ertugrul will go to Aleppo.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.860
Gundogdu.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.260
I have things to discuss with you.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.300
Stay here.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.040
Ertugrul, you go and prepare yourself.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.400
Tell Ilyas Fakih that
he will be coming with you.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.900
Come on!

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.000
Come on! Quick!

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.860
Faster, Turgut, faster! Come on!

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.860
Come on!

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.000
-I won!
-I won!

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.060
Don’t be ridiculous, I won!
I passed the line first!

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.030
-What are you saying?
-I was the first to pass the line!

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.460
Ask Aykiz!

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.330
That won’t be fair.
She is your sweetheart.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.530
How can you say this, Bamsi Beyrek?
When did I ever lie?

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.130
-I told you not to do that!
-Or what?

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.430
-Your brain is as big as a walnut.
-But I am a hard nut to crack!

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.260
Don’t be afraid! Come on then! Come on!

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.260
Stop right there! Stop!

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.430
What is wrong with Ertugrul?

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.430
Suleyman Shah called him to his tent.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.330
-I wonder what the problem is.
-He is probably going gazelle hunting.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.000
That gazelle deserved to be hunted.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.130
Get ready. We are setting off for Aleppo.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.400
Bamsi! We are going to Aleppo, Bamsi!

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.000
I was getting fat sitting all day!

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.960
Tell Ilyas Fakih as well,
he is coming with us.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:20.560
I brought up the Aleppo idea.
I told you that El Aziz needed soldiers.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.830
Why him and not me, father?

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.530
Because of this, son.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.900
“I know. I can do it. I said.”

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.330
When did you become so arrogant?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.230
Am I the arrogant one?
The whole tribe is starving.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.130
Famine is everywhere.
We could not even go on a foray.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.600
Why?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.100
-Because our Bey has a carbuncle problem.
-Know your place!

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.300
Let it go, father. The whole tribe
complains about your old age.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.800
-Brother?
-Get your hands off me!

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.930
Do you think it is your brother’s right
to be the ambassador?

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.530
Yes.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.500
Why me and not my brother?

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.400
His desire to be in charge is burning his soul.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.330
So I put out the flame.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.860
Now, let us talk about
the flame within you.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.030
Our guests will stay
with the tribe until you come back.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.400
I am telling you this so that
you can focus on your mission.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.300
Do not come back empty-handed from Aleppo.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.860
The future of Kayi is on your shoulders.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.100
Your failure will mean
the calamity of all of us.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.000
For the land El Aziz is going to give us,
we shall accept any price.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.300
But not a single Oguz
is a sacrificial lamb.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.600
Don’t you ever forget.
As much as you need a home near Aleppo...

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.600
...Ameer of Aleppo needs Kayi’s Alps.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.260
Do not ever bow your head down.
Show them that you are a real Oguz...

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.330
...who knows what he wants and
is ready to make a just deal.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.260
May God help you.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.200
I shall succeed in my duty
even if the cost is my life, father.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.830
I shall be back to make you proud.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.330
What happened?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.360
Gundogdu!

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.460
-Gundogdu, stop! Stop!
-Leave me alone!

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.560
Hamza Alp! Alps!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.030
Stop! Please!

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.230
Out! Get out!

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.860
Aren’t you going to talk?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.260
Ambassador.
Ertugrul became the ambassador.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.060
-I told you!
-Enough!

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.530
Take it! Drink.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.000
Drink this.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.000
This must be Mother Hayme’s doing.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.300
I don’t care less. It does not matter.
I know what I am going to do.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.160
No! Please do not act in fury.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.500
Those who act with fury always lose.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.130
Enough, woman!
For the love of God, enough!

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.100
Finish your business.
Be ready with your Alps.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.560
When that tactless brother of yours
messes everything up...

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.460
...you will get what you deserve.
And do not forget.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.430
Angels of death wait for
the big day in the Bey’s tent.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.100
The news got stuck in my throat, Turgut.
I cannot swallow it...

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.600
...nor can I spit it out.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.160
You talk like this is the first time
we will be apart, Aykiz.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.460
When did we ever be together, Turgut?

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.430
Is waiting for the road at your father’s
tent and waiting for your man...

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.500
...in your husband’s tent be the same?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.960
It is not the sorrow of separation
that is stuck in my throat...

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.330
...it is not being able to come together.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.430
Anytime we talk about getting married,
it gets delayed for some reason.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.960
I promise.
There will be no delay this time.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.300
I don’t know whether
Aleppo will be a success or not but...

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.330
...the first wedding in our new land
will be ours. I promise you.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:15.100
The drummers will cry out “Aykiz and
Turgut are finally getting married.”

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.560
All the girls in the weaving area
will say, “the most beautiful girl...

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.430
...of the tribe is getting married,
from now on it will be our turn.”

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.500
When you leave Deli Demir’s tent,
even the Sultan’s daughters will...

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.800
...get jealous of your beauty.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.030
I wanted to say how sorry I am.
I do not know the words...

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.500
...that can describe this pain.
-Only you can understand me, Elanora.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.230
Your father’s killers were
Muslims as well.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.460
May you have a good journey, Titus.
Be careful.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.000
I will be back, Elanora. See you soon.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.930
You have witnessed a good commander
transform into a real Templar knight.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.300
Revenge.
That was the only thing lacking in Titus.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.060
A knight is no different than an ordinary soldier
without the desire for vengeance.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.400
Bisol’s death became Titus’ miracle.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.400
May God forgive Bisol’s sins.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:04.600
Looking at the presents, I can say that
Suleyman Shah realized the mistake he did.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.160
Our Bey likes the Seljuk,
he respects them.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.430
But only I can solve this issue,
Kara Toygar.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.100
The time I gave you finishes
tomorrow morning Kurdoglu.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:26.030
Or else the Seljuk’s wrath will burn
the whole Kayi tribe.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.100
-You would burn with us, Kara Toygar.
-How dare you?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.560
Don’t tell me that
the Sultan knows about this.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.100
Your manpower is not enough
to take them from Kayi by force.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.200
You need to raise a whole army.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.900
I am aware that you have armies
that are strong enough to crush Kayi.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:54.330
You can do that. But first,
the Sultan would have to be informed.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.330
That doesn’t work for you. To be honest,
it doesn’t work for us either.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:06.060
I shall come to the point. For you and
the tribe to win at the same time...

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.330
...you need to hear what I have to say.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.430
If you aim to cooperate...

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.600
...tell me. Who did this?

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.300
Was it Suleyman Shah?

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.600
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.300
Bamsi, Dogan.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.360
I heard that you are setting off.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.430
When?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.130
We will leave for Aleppo after the morning prayer.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.230
Are you prepared?

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.130
The Alps are always ready for anything.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.430
True. Everything seems easy
when you get used to it.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.830
Sometimes it gets harder
when you get used to it.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.530
May you have a good journey.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.160
May the sun not burn you.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.830
May you don’t get cold.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.230
May your feet don’t touch a stone.
May you go like water...

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
...return to your tribe like water.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.500
My horse shall fly me to
my destination and back to my tribe.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.160
Your father and mother would be happy.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.900
What about you?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.100
Me?

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.600
I would be long gone.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.400
You cannot go...

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.230
...before I come back.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.260
Your father would not recover fully.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.260
May you have a good journey, Ertugrul Bey.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.900
Who knows maybe...

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.400
There is something I wonder.
Our involuntary guests...

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.400
...are they relatives of
Sultan Aladdin or something?

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.400
-That does not concern you!
-True. It does not concern me.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.430
Come to the point. What is on your mind?

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.330
If you want to take what you want,
I shall have one small condition.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.060
Ertugrul...

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.860
...whatever my late wife and Aykiz are...

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.930
...Halime and her family are the same
for me. Don’t you worry about them.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.530
May God bless you, Deli Demir.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:28.600
May God bless you instead.
Trust makes a man grow.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:35.930
You trusted me in this tribe,
you came to my door, you honored me...

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:43.030
...that is why may God bless you. Halime
and her family is my responsibility.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.160
You can rest assured.
Come on, may God be with you.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.200
My son. My life.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.430
My dear son...

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.530
...may your road
and fortune be always open.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.230
The weight of Kayi is on your shoulders...

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.300
...never bow your head
nor give a promise you cannot keep.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.100
Godspeed.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.560
You may be going and not coming back.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.500
You may come back but not see me.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.100
I will ride tirelessly to see you again.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.200
Godspeed, Ertugrul.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.000
While you were being punished for
rebelling against your father...

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.160
...the little Bey became the ambassador.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.200
I knew you would come.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.360
Welcome.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.960
I don’t care about the prisoners,
Kara Toygar.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.530
They ran away in your territory.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.460
We did our part.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.430
Give me the name of the person
who killed my brother.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.360
You are impatient to be a hangman.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.560
Be careful, don’t let the noose of
the hangman gets around your neck.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.600
Don’t blame me for your clumsiness.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:02.130
The knights you brag about could not
deal with a few trifling Alps.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.360
What do you want in exchange for his name?

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.800
I will give you more than you want.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.860
I will deliver him directly to you.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.100
This is not an issue of business.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:24.030
Do you understand me?
It’s just a favor to a friend in pain.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.330
We pay back to those who help us.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.330
Alright.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.300
Who?

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.300
Suleyman Shah’ son...

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.160
...Ertugrul.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.560
Aykiz...

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.930
...can you look at these patterns as well?

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.230
I won’t be long.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.130
When are you leaving?

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.160
When my father says so.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.560
Do not try to stand strong.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.930
People do not stay in a place
where they are not welcomed.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.130
If you have some sense of shame,
go at once.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.360
It is customary.
You cannot tell your guest to leave.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.600
That is why everyone keeps quiet.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:35.960
And...

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.030
...is this how you repay these people?

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.460
Is this what you deem proper for people
who gave you bread, their own tent...

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800
...and dressed your wounds?

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.130
-I...
-You...

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.360
While you try to flirt around,
blood will be shed in the tribe.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.460
Blood. Go your own way.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.800
Halime! Halime!

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.160
Selcan!

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.860
What did you tell the girl?

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.800
What she needed to hear.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.530
Is it your duty to tell her
what she needs to hear?

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.830
I am thinking about
the future of the tribe.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.200
That girl should have heard this long ago.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.960
Such a shame.
Daugther of a Bey forgets our customs.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.200
She talks on top of the words
of her forefathers.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.000
Come to your senses, Selcan.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.600
Don’t be crushed by the rocks
you thought you were crushing.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.530
-What happened?
-Mind your own business!

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.400
Ertugrul has set off with four of his Alps.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.360
An eye for an eye. Divine justice.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.160
-Where’s he headed?
-To Aleppo.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.500
I shall take revenge with my own hands.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.330
I can never let you do that, Titus.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.400
Why?

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.430
I reign over these lands.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.960
In my borders, only I can use force.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.330
Our plan will be disrupted if people hear...

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.360
...that I colluded with a Crusader and shed blood.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.460
This man killed my brother, Kara Toygar.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.230
I want you to bring him to me alive.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.800
I shall take his life with my own hands.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.130
Don’t you worry. I will present him to you
like a sacrificial ram.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.600
Kara Toygar is convinced, my Bey.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.400
He wanted us to look after them
until they get better.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.200
Did you manage to learn who they are?

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.560
The pig’s son did not even utter
a single word about it.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.600
If they made the great Seljuks stand up,
the issue must be serious.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.600
Our part should be to benefit from this.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.130
You asked for me, my Bey.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.530
If that’s all Kurdoglu, go and rest.
You must be tired from the road.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.130
Help me get rid of this damned carbuncle, Akcakoca.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.990
If God permits, my Bey.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.960
My death will be from this.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.330
-Keep me informed about everything.
-As you wish, my Bey.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:06.130
Everything is ready, father.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.560
I have all the provisions ready,
we will be going tonight.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.260
Don’t worry about your wound, I watched
Akcakoca very closely to see what he does.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.030
Halime, calm down, my girl.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.860
We will be running away from a place
we took refuge, as usual. That is all.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.330
Is that all, father?

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.430
Is it only that for you?

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.230
I don’t know what goes through
your mind but...

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.830
...what makes this place
different for you?

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.530
Is there anything you are not telling me?

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.300
I am very tired, father.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.300
I am tired of running away.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:12.460
Let us start a new life.
Go somewhere where no one will find us.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:17.060
Let us go beyond deserts and seas
but go from here, that is all I want.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.930
Father?

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.060
What happened, son? What happened, Yigit?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.600
We have a guest. He wants to come in.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.260
Let him in.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.100
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.000
Please.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.230
Father, look. Deli Demir made
a sword for you and my sister.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.830
He is the best ironsmith in the region.
He makes the best swords.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.200
Please don’t exaggerate, son.
Ours is only a pastime.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.860
-These are yours.
-Thank you.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.200
Don't mention it, my girl.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:01.430
As Ertugrul Bey is not here,
I did not want you to be without weapons.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.200
He would feel more comfortable.
I would do too.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.460
Anyway, I am at my workshop
but my eye is on your tent.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.430
If you need anything,
please do not hesitate.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.260
What could happen in a big tribe?

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.030
Look, my girl.
Ertugrul Bey is like a son to me.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.900
So, I would never turn back his request.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.300
This was not called for.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.030
We will go this way.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.860
Tell Ertugrul that horses should
rest a bit. They are exhausted.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.830
His mind is with Halime.
He wants to return before they go.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.300
If you have the courage, you tell him.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.900
My Bey.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.060
Us being exhausted is not an issue
but the horses are very tired.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.400
My Bey, shall we rest a bit
beside the stream?

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.060
We can set camp down there.
We will set off before sunrise.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.530
-Dogan, light a fire.
-As you wish, my Bey.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.030
Follow me quietly.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.300
Peace be upon you.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.900
Peace be upon you too.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.260
What happened to the gazelle?

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:09.230
We found it like this. It was probably
wounded while running away from a hunter.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.860
I think that the hunter was me.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:24.860
You must be not a good one
since you let this one escape.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.260
I guess so, Dervish.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.200
Look at that beautiful face. So you
managed to escape from this big valiant.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:41.100
Well done to you.
In the name of God, may you recover soon.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.000
Come on now. Go. Go on.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.830
Where are you coming from and
where are you headed to?

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.260
I come from the exalted and
to Him I shall return.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.830
What about you?

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.360
We are headed to Aleppo.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.160
Then keep your eyes open all times.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.830
Don’t become a hunt for
wolves and vultures.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.100
The air here is very hazy.
Don’t be lost in the haze.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.530
Will you grant me your name?

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.460
Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.
