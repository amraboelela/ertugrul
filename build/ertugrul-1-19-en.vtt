00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.030
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.460
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.340
How will you take me in?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.140
There is a secret passage that goes
to the dungeons. My vizier told me.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.780
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.040
Don’t give in, son! Be strong!

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.400
They will test your will to the limits.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.860
What more can they do to me?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.430
I do not care about myself...

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.560
...I wonder what they are doing
to that innocent boy.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.600
They might have even killed him.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.280
Look, young man...

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.620
...if your body is in this dungeon...

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.840
...the thing that awaits you
is much more than death itself.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.960
If you are so sure about what will happen to us...

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.400
...you must know those infidels well.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.900
Because I know them so well,
I am in this dungeon for 17 years.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.800
How did you bear this for so long?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.080
With love.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.960
Don’t stop even for a moment 
thinking about the One...

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.360
...who enlightens the darkness in you 
when you close your eyes.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.760
-Are you a hunter.
-I am the hunt this time.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.320
The new home will be a new and joyous life
for all of us. Especially for us.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.220
-Does Aleppo have everything?
-It has everything.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.880
When we reach there, it will be complete.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.900
We will go and we will wed.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.360
This is my promise to you.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.000
Aykiz?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.440
Let me see?

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.960
It is a deep wound.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.300
Thank you.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.960
Aykiz...

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.680
...I was presumptuous.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.900
I broke your heart.
But believe me, it was not my intention.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.020
When you talked like that
about Ertugrul...

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.580
Aykiz, there is nothing
in my hand except my dreams and hopes.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.140
It’s only my hope that keeps me alive.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.160
If I lose it, I cannot live anymore.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.780
You cannot soothe your pain
by hurting others, Gokce.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.180
But do not despair so much.
My problem is not you.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.800
I thought that as we near Aleppo
I would be relieved...

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.280
...I would be joyous with
seeing Turgut again.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.860
But now there is a shadow 
casting over my heart.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.220
It’s like I’m not getting closer 
but away from my loved one.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.030
I keep dreaming about our memories.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.140
Don’t tire your heart in vain, Aykiz.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.220
Amid the hardships and
sorrows we go through...

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.560
...your love is like a flower
that heralds the spring.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.900
Ertugrul’s love made you a poet.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.880
May God bless us all.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.560
I only want to meet Turgut safe and sound,
that is enough for me.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.000
Come on.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.640
I am hungry as a bear, Hatun.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.420
Can’t you hurry up a bit?

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.880
I am coming, my Bey.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.960
I have prepared your favorite meal.
It has been a while since we ate alone.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.020
-May it be healthy, Gundogdu.
-Thank you, Hatun.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.180
May it be healthy.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.940
Hatun, I’m engaged with the matters of our tribe.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.680
You are right, Gundogdu.
You are like the Bey of the tribe right now.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.960
It’s not easy to handle all this.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.360
May God give you strength.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.600
-Come on! In the name of God. Please.
-In the name of God.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.320
Do I have permission, Gundogdu?

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.180
Gundogdu.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.900
What do you want?

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.760
Control yourself, Gundogdu.
Don’t do anything you might regret.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.460
You stay away from this, Selcan Hatun.
There are things you don’t know.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.160
Yes...

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.680
...these are the things
that happened, my Bey.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.320
But as you have opened your eyes,
nothing is important anymore...

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.920
...they will all pass away,
if God permits.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.900
Now, even if all hell breaks loose,
we can put it out with our hearts, my Bey.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.740
As long as we fight shoulder on shoulder, 
nothing can defeat us.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.060
You have always stood by me, Deli Demir.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.040
You have always supported me in any difficulty.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.800
You are more than a brother to me.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.100
When you talk about brotherhood, my Bey...

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.300
...you, I, Kurdoglu...

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.840
...Alpsungur.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.980
Yes, we once were.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.400
Look, we still are so but…

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.800
The older the friendship, the stronger the ties, my Bey. Old friends like you and me.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.220
Did you see Kurdoglu? He could not hit
a bear in front of him in the old times.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.700
As he gets older, his eyes started
seeing better than a hawk, God bless.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.740
This man… the man I call my uncle… 
the man that our Shah calls his blood brother…

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.360
But what did he do?
He tried to kill our Shah.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.980
The matter is not like you think,
Gundogdu.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.980
-First, you have to listen to me.
-What will you tell me? What?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.860
How you panicked when I told you
that you secretly went into the tent?

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.220
Or how you went to finish off the job
in the middle of the night? Which one?

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.400
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.600
I went to save Suleyman Shah from
the fury of the rabid son of Baybora.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.340
I saved our Bey at the last second.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.900
Moreover, it was you who warned me
by telling me the tear in the tent.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.180
It was Bozok who went
into the tent that night.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.940
I went after him so that he wouldn’t be able 
to complete his will.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.320
And...

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.000
...I just came to congratulate you.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.160
Mother Hayme told me.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.000
I came here to say how happy I’m for our nephew.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.860
Everyone in the tribe is talking about that.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.460
Did Suleyman Shah,
our father heard it as well?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.300
What did he say?

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.940
He was the happiest one.
Suleyman Shah was overjoyed with...

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.360
...the news of a grandson.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.220
Anyway...

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.820
...I said what I came to say.
I should not bother you anymore.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.420
Everything happened as you expected,
Ertugrul Bey.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.520
Yes, it did.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.840
They've become prey while they were the hunters,
with God’s permission.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.720
But the situation is more complex
than we thought.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.500
If Sahabeddin’s most trusted maid
whom he sent for me is a traitor...

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.880
...the vizier is caught in the trap.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.520
If a lion is caught in a trap 
even the coyotes nurse a grudge.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.820
Whatever it takes, we do have to save him.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.220
I will be gone for a while, Ertugrul Bey.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.720
Is this the right time, Afsin Bey.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.800
Will you be leaving us alone
in this fight?

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.720
Ertugrul Bey, I know that you wonder
who I am, how far I can reach and...

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.620
...where my roots are. I will answer
all your questions and more in time.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.520
But now, we have to pass through a bridge
that is thinner than a hair and...

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.900
...sharper than a sword. I ask for
one thing and that is for you to trust me.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:26.260
We fought side by side, Afsin Bey. 
We have the merit of a war between us.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.360
I trust you.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.000
Tomorrow you should go to the Turkmen
carpet man in the market, Ertugrul Bey.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.440
His name is Aykutluk.
He will help you in every way he can.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.600
And I will enter through
the gates of hell for Turgut and Yigit.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.900
Thank you.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.400
Where did those men come out of?
How could you not see them, Aftalia?

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
He didn’t have time to inform anyone.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.120
It is clear that he became suspicious 
and prepared for it in advance.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.200
But how could you not notice
those two goat herders while walking?

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.740
Do you have an explanation for this?

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.140
I could not see, Commander Titus,
that is why I escaped at the last minute.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.020
Just like you failing against
Ertugrul every single time...

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.720
...I failed to notice his warriors.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.480
You should understand me very well in this
manner as you are much more experienced.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.800
Stop! What are you doing?

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.860
We are all like the apostles
fighting for God’s sheep.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.220
If we don’t trust each other, Jerusalem
can only be a far-reaching dream for us!

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.700
Moreover, when Sahabeddin
is killed tomorrow...

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.400
...Ertugrul will only be like a sewer rat
walking around the streets of Aleppo.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:01.000
Then it’s up to your personal pleasure 
to decide what you will do to him.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.980
You caused all this!

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.640
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.480
Not your father, nor your tribe!

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.340
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.180
Winter is coming and we don’t even
know where to go! Open your eyes!

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.180
Open your eyes!

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.080
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.360
You are lying, Ertugrul.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.400
The eagle is in the cage.
Now it is the wolf’s turn.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.920
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.960
...and my companion till the end.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.340
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.980
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.700
Great God, Creator of the heavens and earth! 
I wended my way to you…

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.120
my aim is to set off for a new path.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.660
You are the owner of both the path and the range.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.120
May You bless us at the end of this road.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.860
My request from you is not the throne, 
not the crown or being the possessor.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.400
I have set off with your name and 
what lies in my heart is...

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.020
...to exalt your name on this path.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.380
My aim of using my sword is to make it 
the servant of the scales of justice.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.760
Oh God! If I ever happen to think 
or feel and lose my path...

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.420
...lead me back to my path 
by the ones who represent justice.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.300
On this path in which I have set off 
to exalt your name...

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.040
...prevent me from thinking of the earthly life...

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.220
...prevent me from following Satan and 
prevent me from getting embarrassed.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.360
Oh God! Let me and my descendants 
serve for your purpose.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.560
Let me and my descendants 
close our eyes as martyrs.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.460
Hamza.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.020
Yes, my Bey?

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.020
Take this and load it to the camel.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.100
Look, Gundogdu.
His little feet will be wearing these.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:03.960
With time our son will grow and
be a valiant man, just like his father.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.760
Your heart and mine is beating
right here now.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.420
Everything we have, all our hopes,
our happiness is here now.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.820
He will be our life, our blood,
future of our progeny.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.420
You will see that
all troubles will be left behind.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.260
The new homeland will be
a new world for us.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.140
If God permits, Hatun, if God permits.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.000
Let us complete
this migration journey first.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.680
Come on, I have some business to
attend to, you should get ready as well.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.720
Father?

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.960
We ran away for so long...

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.340
...we faced so many troubles...

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.280
...we went through so much...

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.700
But in the end,
we could not protect Yigit.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.560
There is nothing we can do
but pray, father.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.260
Look at me.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.740
I cannot even move.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.640
We will find a way in the end, Halime.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.120
God will surely open up a blessed path
in front of us in time.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.280
Ertugrul Bey promised me.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.220
He will not let Yigit and Turgut Alp
be captive in enemy hands.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.260
He will not, right, father?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.440
Your wound is very serious. I beg you,
don’t distress yourself so much, Halime.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.160
There is a Turkmen carpet man
around here with the name of Aykutluk.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.640
Do you know his place?

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.840
Wake up! Wake up!

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.160
Wake up!

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.320
Be patient, my girl, Leila, be patient.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.360
Do not throw yourself
into those dark wells once again.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.440
May God help you.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.740
-Didn’t she eat?
-No.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.360
Today will be a difficult day
for all of us.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.420
We do not know how it will end.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.860
No news about our vizier
shall reach Leila Sultan, do you understand me?

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:16.460
As you wish. We will of course be careful.
But, how can something like this be?

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.800
How can our great vizier,
Sahabeddin Tugrul...

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.880
...whom no one can suspect his honesty
and righteousness be put on trial?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.840
You are right. We don’t know with
what kind of a slander he was imprisoned.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.140
The only thing we can do for him
is to pray to God. You may leave.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.860
God! God! God!

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.440
God! God! God!

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.260
God! God! God!

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.060
Welcome, Ertugrul.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.480
Those mad men of ours have been giving 
the good news of your coming.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.160
Are all those mad men, beggars and
drunkards your comrades?

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.460
When mayors are being bought
and sold in the market...

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.860
...we work with mad men
in this life or death market.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.680
We need to rescue
the vizier from the dungeon.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.740
We need at least one week, my lad.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.520
We need to contact the guards in
the dungeon, arrange their schedule.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.860
Besides, Sahabeddin has his trial today.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.580
In the Muslim world the balance of justice
is not that crooked yet.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.680
We should not lose hope from God.
We should wait for the outcome.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.360
What if it is crooked?

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.700
What will we do then?

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.840
If betrayal harms justice...

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.220
...then our swords will bring those ones 
to the right path.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.440
But, Nasir...

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.800
...this is dangerous.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.080
Judge Effendi!

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.460
You never thought of any danger while 
pouring your belt with gold-filled sacks.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.120
You were saying the vizier is as good as
dead. Why do you tremble like a leaf now?

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.660
And...

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.180
...think well, Judge Effendi...

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.140
...after the issue of the
vizier is done...

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.980
...his highness Melik will need
consultants like you beside him.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.340
Can you really do this, Nasir?

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.860
Of course.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.640
You are very important to me, 
Judge Effendi.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.220
It is not easy to find a man
that can be bought so easily in Aleppo.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.600
On behalf of Emirate  of Aleppo,
Melik El Aziz.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.060
In the name of God; The Embodiment of Justice, 
The Retaliator...

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.460
...The All-Prevailing One and The Beneficent...

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.640
...we shall commence the trial of  Emirate
of Aleppo Vizier, Sahabeddin Tugrul.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.320
The accusations are murder,
disobedience of an order...

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.520
...breach of confidence, betrayal of trust 
to the city of Aleppo...

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.000
...and the Muslim world.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.340
I am one of the private guards of
Sahabeddin Tugrul...

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.440
...he ordered me to provide him with 
a highly effective poison.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.240
I did as I was ordered.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.220
I saw the people who tried to kill the
Kayi envoy with the vizier in the market.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.660
The vizier was giving something to them
in a pouch. I am sure that it was gold.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.620
I am a trader, the vizier forced me...

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.160
...he used me as a tool for his trade business...

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.640
...in Antioch, the Earldom of the Crusaders.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.580
Sahabeddin Tugrul, you heard
the accusations.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.980
Is there anything you wish to say?

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.980
I deny all that has been said.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.500
The people speaking here are 
false witnesses that were paid to lie.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.160
This is the council of rights and truths.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.820
These eyes distinguish the truth from the lie...

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.120
...as they distinguish black from white 
with the permission of God.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.820
You do not need to worry.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.100
Call in the last witness.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.100
God send you to us, sister Ummulhayr.
We were going to send a message to you.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.620
-We have a problem.
-Peace be upon you.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.660
-And peace be upon you.
-Welcome, sister. What happened?

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.740
You talked about an important matter.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.840
I do not know whether you heard about
what happened to our vizier.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.140
Sahabeddin Tugrul is
an honest person inside and outside.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.200
He is a valuable statesman
Great God has bestowed upon us.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.000
Everyone knows that he had been doing
his duties in a competent manner.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.120
He is going through a difficult test...

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.200
...May God the Opener, the Judge help him.
-Amen.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.720
Leila has learned about her uncle.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.440
She is devastated since she learned that
it was her brother who arrested him.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.700
I worry that she may fall ill once again
and turn her back on life.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.800
Poor girl, she was recovering
quite well recently, wasn’t she?

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.360
Yes. She had recovered with
the support of our vizier but...

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.720
How can we of help, sister?

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:48.940
I...

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.100
...if it is possible...

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.380
...she may be refreshed with
a conversation with our Sheikh Effendi.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.680
I just thought that she could have 
a relief with his divine light...

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.820
...before she gets worse. 
-You thought well.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.180
I shall inform our Sheikh
and tell you about his decision.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.020
May God bless you.
I heard that you have a problem as well.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.800
We have visitors in our lodge.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.400
They are also going
through difficult tests.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.580
A young girl like Leila is wounded.
The doctor did all he could but...

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.200
...the wound is getting worse.
The cure is in God’s hands.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.380
If the palace physician checks her,
maybe he can find a remedy.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.760
Of course, I will immediately
tell him to visit you tomorrow.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.100
The girl’s condition
is an emergency, sister.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.200
Will you swear on the Qur’an 
that there won’t be any lies...

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.840
...nor contradictions about 
what you will tell us?

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.280
I do, my Effendi.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.000
Tell everything as you
told me before, my girl...

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.800
...and do not be afraid of anyone.
What happened in that room that day?

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.140
The vizier and I went into
the room the killer was in, Effendi.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.920
Was there anyone else who knew that room?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.980
What did you see when you went in?

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.300
The man...

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.820
...was lying down.
He started to tremble...

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.880
...and his mouth foamed up.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.000
He was poisoned…

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.200
He…

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.820
...he died in the arms of my vizier.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.960
You may leave, my girl.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.080
We have heard enough.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.480
The decision has been made.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.360
The physician has completed
his examination.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.200
You were wise to inform us.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.480
The wound is infected, 
her condition is not well.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.140
-I have given her a small medical treatment.
-May God bless you.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.700
But we cannot do much here.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.380
She needs to be looked after in the palace
and treated with special medicine.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.000
We can take her to the palace. If her
condition requires it, we shall abide.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.760
Physician, can you tell us what to do
so that we can treat her here?

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.760
I don’t find it in my heart 
to let her out of my sight.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.760
Her situation is critical,
she may not come out of this alive...

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.040
...we did whatever can be done here,
we shall do the same in the palace.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.280
But only God knows
what the outcome will be.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.000
You can rest assured, Effendi.
Your daughter is entrusted to me.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.780
I will personally take care of her.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.880
Ummulhayr Hanim is my sister.
She will look after your daughter well...

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.280
...in the palace and she was also
the governess of El Aziz and his sister.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.320
Sultan Aziz is like her son.
If God permits, there'll be no problem...

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.660
...you can rest assured.
