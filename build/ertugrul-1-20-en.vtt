00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.030
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.500
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.560
Thank God, you are better, right?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.420
Thank God, Hayme.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.800
This shows that we still have a breath to take 
in this mortal world.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.740
Yes, if God permits, we shall have
our grandchild in our arms soon.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.980
It was time anyway.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.660
This is the only joyous news I heard.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.860
We have been dreaming of a grandchild 
for years.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.840
Thanks to Gundogdu and Selcan, 
we will be filled with joy.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.860
May God give them the chance
to see their own grandchildren.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.460
If God permits. If God permits, my Bey.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.700
The Emirate of Aleppo can be seen.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.700
Flag off! Seal on!

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.800
Rahman! Bring my horse!

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.880
We need to enter
our new homeland on a horse.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.800
Here you are, my Bey.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.880
Thank you, God.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.200
You did not leave our tribe without a Bey.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.160
What is the situation?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.560
My Bey, the front door is guarded
very heavily. There is another door...

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.360
...at the back for provisions,
we may be able to enter from there but...

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.440
...I don't know whether
we would be able to get out.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.480
People who heard that
the vizier is being tried have gathered.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.160
The guards are having
a hard time containing them.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.560
They are convinced that
Sahabeddin Tugrul is tried unjustly.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.960
If we manage to get the vizier out
we can take advantage of the crowd and can escape.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.940
-That is all I can say, my Bey.
-Do not listen to him, my Bey.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.420
We don't know where the dungeons are.
It is very hard without help from inside.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.520
If you ask me, we would be caught
before we even reach Sahabeddin.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.800
What news do you have, my Bey?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.720
I will tell you. First, we should go
to the lodge and see how Halime is.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.600
Yigit.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.200
Ertugrul.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.900
Poor Girl.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.880
Please do not worry, Numan Efendi.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.020
When we reach the palace
Halime will be much better.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.520
Hear ye, hear ye!

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.830
Hear ye, hear ye!

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.000
Hear ye, hear ye!

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.480
It has been decided that
our highness Giyaseddin El Aziz's...

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.400
...traitor vizier Sahabeddin Tugrul 
has colluded with the infidels...

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.600
...and the verdict is
that he is to be executed.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.760
-Sahabeddin is our father!
-He would never do such a thing!

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.400
Let me beat them, my Bey. 
That will teach them a lesson.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.340
The execution will be carried out 
this afternoon.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.040
Fie! You can’t hang him! You can’t hang him!

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.960
Sahabeddin is our father!

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.340
You are the traitors, not him!

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.180
Sahabeddin is our father!

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.060
You are the traitors, not him!

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.540
You imprisoned him! You! It’s slander!

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.800
My Pir...

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.720
...our dear brother, sage and fellow 
Sahabeddin Tugrul...

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.300
...is being tried on the ground of 
various slanders.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.120
Our hearts ache deeply for him.
What do you suggest we do?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.440
Our God, who saved Jonas 
from the belly of the fish...

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.120
...Ayyub from the worm eating into his wound...

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.960
...Joseph from the well...

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.860
...Moses from the Nile...

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.360
...and the last Prophet from the cave...

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.800
...will also save our brother, if He wishes.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.940
We shall take refuge in Him.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.160
Our God, who turned the fire into a rose garden 
that Abraham fell into...

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.940
...will also turn the dungeon into the venter 
that Sahabeddin Tugrul is in.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.840
Those who wait for tyranny, murder and
treason to emerge from there...

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.160
...would be bewildered when
a resurrection emerges.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.330
Do not worry, Turkmen.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.820
When I'm done with you...

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.560
...you won’t remember any of this pain 
you have suffered.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.800
Hello, young man.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.830
-Who are you?
-Yigit.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.360
What are you doing here, Yigit?

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.860
-I was not doing anything bad.
-Were you looking for someone?

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.230
Would you like me to help you?

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.000
Yes.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.260
Then tell me, who are you looking for?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.100
-My brother Turgut.
-Who is this brother Turgut?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.960
He is a very powerful warrior.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.200
He is very tall, he has very strong arms.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.900
So he is very powerful.
Do you like your brother Turgut very much?

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.900
Yes, I do. He is a very good man.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.160
Come.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.300
I don’t find it in my heart 
to leave you here like that, Hatun.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.500
Not at all.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.860
It is God's will, my Bey. God forbid,
what if something happens to the tribe...

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.160
...during the migration,
what would they do without Akcakoca?

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.500
Come on, let us go in.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.560
Everyone thinks that this is
the wisest decision, my Bey.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.460
You gave the best decision like a Bey.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.960
May God help them.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.060
Amen.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.000
Are you two ready for the journey?

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.330
We are, my Bey.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.500
We are.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.000
Come on, then.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.200
-In the name of God.
-In the name of God.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.820
May God be with you, Hatun.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.800
You too. Godspeed.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.400
Halt!

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.800
Who are you?

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.600
I am from the Bozok branch of Oguz,
Bey of Kayi tribe, Suleyman Shah.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.700
We are headed to the land 
that was granted to my tribe...

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.320
by Giyaseddin El Aziz 
the Ameer of Aleppo.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.460
We are here on the orders of El Aziz.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.340
We were ordered not to let you enter the city...

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.520
...and to accompany you until you leave 
the lands of Aleppo.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.460
-Let him go, he is not a traitor!
-Let him go!

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.040
Help Halime to the bed there.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.000
-Murderers!
-Let him go!

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.440
-You are the real murderers!
-Traitors!

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.140
Traitors!

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.060
-You cannot do this!
-You murderers!

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.000
-Traitors!
-Murderers!

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.740
-Traitors!
-Murderers!

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.340
Vizier, do you have a last word?

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.530
Do not remember me as a traitor!

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.160
Whatever I have done, has always been 
for the peace of the people.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.460
Quran is my guide and God is my witness!

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.400
My head is up!

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.400
My only purpose is the path of God.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.940
If it’s my fate to die for this purpose...

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.160
...either in my sleep...

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.500
...or by an axe, doesn't matter.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.200
What will we do, my Bey?

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.430
Will we return?

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.360
We cannot turn back now, Deli Demir.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.000
The tribe must have started the migration.
We should not worry them.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.200
Rahman!

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.800
Yes, my Bey?

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.130
Is there a place we can stay around here?

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.500
Have a look around.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.800
Yahya! Come with me.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.600
What will happen now, father?

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.460
Won't we go to Aleppo?

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.100
Do not worry, my son.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.000
Your brother Ertugrul will
bring us the news sooner or later.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.860
Then we will get to know
the truth about this issue.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.230
We set off with hope, but ended up 
in disappointment, mother Hayme.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.860
I am sure something happened to Turgut.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.330
Do not say things like that, my girl.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.200
Do not fuel your anxiety.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.860
Brave women of Kayi...

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.030
...shall stand strong like a mountain...

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.000
...so that the brave men of Kayi
can roar like a mountain lion.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.300
Mother Hayme is right, Aykiz.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.830
If there was a problem,
Ertugrul would inform us.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.560
I know that she is right as well.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.800
But this time Turgut went
without even saying goodbye.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.160
That is why I feel anxious.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.200
My brave girls.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.330
Please be rest assured...

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.960
...they have overcome so many battles,
so many troubles.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.600
Even if they are in trouble, even if they
are in distress, they will come back.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.460
Amanos Mountains
Templars Castle

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.330
Aykiz. My Aykiz.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.460
What are you doing here?

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.360
Turgut. My Turgut.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.060
-Turgut.
-What are you doing here?

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.930
My Aykiz? What are you doing here?

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.360
My son! The voices you hear are not real!

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.130
Do not surrender to them.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.430
Whoever you are hearing...

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.500
...is not in the dungeon with you now.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.060
You have to resist the poison they gave you.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.560
How? How?

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.030
“Assuredly in the remembrance of God 
do hearts find tranquillity.”

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.430
Only true friend is God and the rest is nothing.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.960
Escape from the lie they gave you 
and seek shelter in God.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.400
What do I need to do?

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.500
Join me, my son.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.940
“So, know (O Prophet), that there is none 
worthy of worship but God.”

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.600
There is none worthy of worship but God.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.740
There is none worthy of worship but God.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.680
There is none worthy of worship but God.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.960
There is none worthy of worship but God.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.260
There is none worthy of worship but God.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.140
My Turgut.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:56.860
There is none worthy of worship but God.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.260
Our journey is challenging.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.930
Our destination shall bring us joy,
if God permits.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.260
Come on, Hatun. You should smile.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.300
Should our child see his mother frowning
when he is born?

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.930
That is it.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.230
You will give birth to our child
in our new homeland.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.530
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.430
Aleppo will bring peace to us.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.200
Vizier, do you have a last word?

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:53.530
Do not remember me as a traitor!

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.200
Whatever I have done has always been 
for the peace of the people.

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.600
Quran is my guide and God is my witness!

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.360
My head is up!

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.220
My only purpose is the path of God.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.300
If it’s my fate to die for this purpose...

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.900
...either in my sleep...

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.260
...or by an axe, doesn't matter!

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.000
-Murderers!
-Liars!

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.930
Mighty God!

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.500
Catch Sahabeddin! Don’t let him escape!

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.060
Nasir, what is happening here?

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.260
Do not worry, your highness.
All streets are deployed with guards.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.930
They cannot run anywhere.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:24.530
Catch him!

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.600
Don't let Sahabeddin escape!

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.060
-Mighty God!
-Mighty God!

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.600
Up!

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.800
Finally, Nasir…
Finally, we are home again.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.830
Your highness, we are talking about
the snakes who sneak up into...

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.600
...our warm and secure home.
We should never forget this.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.860
Please stay away from the balcony.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.530
Your highness...

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.330
...you saw today what a bowman can do.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.500
God forbid, you might be
an open target in the balcony.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.300
What is happening to our precious jewel...

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:19.100
...to our one and only Aleppo, Nasir?

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.830
Behind you!

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:30.260
Today people died right in front of me.
My uncle Sahabeddin was kidnapped.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:36.200
A group of rascals has caused chaos
in my city.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.830
Who are the people
helping Ertugrul, Nasir?

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:45.330
Sahabeddin's collaborators,
the remainders of the Crusaders.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.000
The goons they hired. The tramps they fed.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:54.100
Infidels who hid themselves
under a Muslim identity.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.900
Today they united against you.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.200
Find them and bring them here, Nasir.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:06.860
I want to see them die in agony
with my own eyes.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.460
Do not worry, your highness.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.300
But you should still be careful.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.860
Traitors have infiltrated everywhere.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.860
If we consider that even Sahabeddin 
is one of them...

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.300
...who knows how far this betrayal 
has reached.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.560
Even the least expected people
might be your enemy.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.530
Even the least expected people
might be your enemy.
