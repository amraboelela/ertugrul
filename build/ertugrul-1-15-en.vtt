RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.900
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.300
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.560
Why is it dark in here?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.860
Rahman!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.130
Yes, my Bey?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.460
Why are these oil lamps not lit, Rahman?

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.200
I don’t know, my Bey.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.300
You’d not even be aware of it, 
if all the hell broke loose

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.900
My Bey?

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.060
-Find something and cover that tear.
-Yes, my Bey.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.600
No one will know about what happened here.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.930
Don’t leave my father alone 
for even one moment.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.930
Yes, my Bey.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.460
Thank God, your pain was as a sign of good.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.830
So, the motherhood starts with pain 
and ends with God’s mercy and grace.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.200
You made us happy in these hard times.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.560
May God permit us to hold
the child in our arms.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.980
If God permits, mother.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.620
If my Bey father recovers soon,
he would be happy too.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.740
Of course, he would. We were yearning
for a grandchild for a long time.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.060
Of course, he would be happy.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.460
-Sister.
-My Gokce.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.360
Gundogdu...

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.340
Son, we have good news.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.440
Our bride Selcan is pregnant.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.880
He will continue our progeny and
become Bey of the tribe, if God permits.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.980
If God permits. Thank you, mother.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.940
-May you be blessed.
-Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.800
You should not have left
my Bey father alone.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.100
He is not alone, Hatun.
Rahman is with him.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.300
You take care and do not worry
about other things.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.020
What a coward.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.160
First, she sent me to the tent.
Then sent her husband after me.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.460
So she wanted Suleyman Shah dead in order
to take revenge for her father Alpsungur.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.400
And she was going to make me
a bait for Gundogdu at the same time.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.220
Two birds with one stone.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.480
I couldn’t predict that ignoble woman’s plan.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.260
When a wolf gets old,
it becomes the laughingstock of the dogs.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.200
What do you say, Alpargu?
Are we too old now?

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.430
Their cries tear my heart apart. I wish
we could kill them before setting on fire.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.100
This illness is not like
the ones you know, son.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.500
If you touch the meat or blood of these
animals, the whole tribe would be doomed.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.840
Our Holy Mother, revive me so that 
I can free myself from the dark.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.960
If my father is alive
and if I can meet him...

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.000
...show me a sign.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.900
Altes...

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.000
...are you here?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.220
Amen.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.160
You told me that you were prepared
to learn the truth.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.280
Then come with me.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.140
-Is it here?
-Yes.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.900
You never saw me, Altes.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.120
Is my father behind this door?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.140
-Father?
-My daughter?

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.200
-Father!
-My girl!

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.240
Father!

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.400
-Father!
-My girl!

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.120
Father,
I thought you were killed years ago.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.980
I always thought of you.
The hope of seeing you again kept me alive.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.800
Father, why are you here?

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.700
Your mother, your sister and
you are in my dreams every night.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.260
-Mother...
-What happened to your mother, my girl?

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.320
We lost her to the plague last year.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.800
Father, why are they holding you here?

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.860
Uncle told us that you were dead.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.700
Does my uncle know that you are here?

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.040
I will talk with him and
take you out of here.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.900
My girl!

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.130
Father?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.360
My girl!

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.830
-Father.
-My daughter.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.900
My baby!

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.840
My baby! My Elanora!

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.060
My baby, my Elanora!

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.500
Help me, God!

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.760
Help me, God!

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.820
In short, Ertugrul Bey,
just like the poet says...

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.100
I burned and turned to ash
I became a guide for the sufferers

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.300
I was a Shah and became a subject
With the fire of your love

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.500
With your permission, my Bey.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.680
It is your turn to take watch.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.500
I could not sleep.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.260
Halime.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.800
You know that...

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.580
...I have a thousand problems.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.940
Their solutions are in my power...

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.400
...and my power is in my belief.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.400
But there’s one...

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.460
...that is the most alluring amongst others...

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.820
...which also tears my heart out.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.020
And the cure for that one is only you.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.200
It was that gazelle with those beautiful eyes 
that took me to you by following it...

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.900
...and then got me in this love.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.020
I aimed to kill it...

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.960
...and it tore my heart out with the fire of love.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.840
What I am trying to say is...

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.200
...since the first moment I saw you...
-Please, Ertugrul. Stop.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.540
I shall not.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.100
I cannot send you away with my own hands.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.280
Do not go.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.840
Stay with me.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.800
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.580
...and my companion till the end.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.940
You are a valiant and honest brave
with a good heart, Ertugrul Bey.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.300
We owe you not one but a thousand lives.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.230
But my fate was sealed a long time ago.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.500
I cannot leave my father and brother
in a world of unknown to go after love.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.740
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.980
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.860
This is your tongue talking.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.300
What about your heart?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.560
What does your heart say, Halime?

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.160
My heart and my tongue talk the same.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.400
Don’t go.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.330
Halime!

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.300
Halime?

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.600
Halime!

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.460
Halime! Halime!

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.780
Halime!

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.860
-Halime!
-Halime!

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.460
Halime. Halime.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.980
Halime, my girl!

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.800
Hold down the rear! Let us separate.
We will meet in Aleppo!

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.860
We shall separate.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.130
Halime.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.030
-Sister?
-Come on, boy! Come on.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.160
-Sister!
-Come on!

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.530
-Sister.
-Come on, we are going.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.130
Go on. Quick! Quick!

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.600
Sir, they are running away.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.960
Ertugrul is trapped now...

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.000
...let us catch the small Shahzada
to please Ustad.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.260
Get the horses.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.960
You carry on, Shahzada.
I will catch up with you.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.940
Come on. Come on!

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.140
My Bey, you catch up with them.
We will guard your back.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.900
Quick, on your horses!

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.060
I will make that coward Selcan regret 
the day she was born, Niya.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.500
She will pay a heavy price for fooling me.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.900
I shall breathe down her neck like death.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.960
There is no end to tricks in Selcan.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.040
She walks in the tribe
like a ball of fire.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.860
She bellows the fire anywhere she likes.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.230
And if my name is Kurdoglu...

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.260
...I know how to turn that fire into ash.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.500
You shall take one life of
that double lived coward.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.220
Before she can hold her baby
in her arms...

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.900
...before she can brag about giving
a grandchild to the Bey bloodline...

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.820
...that baby shall die.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.840
Get out of the way.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.200
My dear lamb...

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.800
...I brought you water, get up.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.230
Was it you...

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.460
...who killed my father Baybora?

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.230
Here you are, my girl.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.030
May it be easy.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.000
May it be easy on you, sister.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.120
With God’s permission, we are ready,
Gundogdu Bey.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.220
What happened, my Bey? Is there something
that clouds your heart, that worries you?

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.800
It’s dangerous around here, Deli Demir.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.420
I will allocate some trusted
Alps for your journey.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.560
You are the son of a Bey, you are a Bey.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.520
You don’t need to tell me everything.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.140
But if there is something
I need to know...

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.760
...you would tell me, right, my Bey?

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.960
I always say that caution is a virtue.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.200
We can’t even trust the clouds above us 
or the blowing wind.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.360
Anyway, you should start
your preparations.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.020
Don’t talk like that, my Bey.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.060
What kind of preparations need to be made 
for a man like me?

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.600
I just have to pay my last respects to someone 
while there is still time for it.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.040
So, I should be doing that.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.300
Yigit!

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.800
Yigit!

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.980
Was it you...

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.060
...who killed my father Baybora?

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.640
Baybora was like a brother to me.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.960
Your father was killed by those who
saw us as a threat to their Seigniory.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.380
What are you trying to say?

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.780
You should understand, the killer of
your father is Suleyman Shah.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.340
Can those we called our Shah and 
obeyed as Beys, kill us, father?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.000
But if I am your son...

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.260
...I shall make them pay for it.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.260
I seek refuge in God from Satan, the Accursed one.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.820
In the name of God, the Compassionate, 
the Merciful.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.540
Amen.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.840
I am going, my dear wife.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.300
Leaving our lands again…

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.900
The caravan is ready.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.400
But this time,
you will not be in the caravan.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.520
You will never be able to see our new land.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.240
First thing will be marrying off our Aykiz 
when the tribe is settled.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.840
That day...

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.720
...I shall cry quietly in a corner.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.000
As you are not beside me,
you won’t be able to wipe my tears.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.680
Aykiz will give me a grandchild
when the time comes.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.340
You won’t be able to hold
those little hands and feet.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:34.990
My battle-worn and battered heart...

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:39.260
...will be even more worn out
being without you.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:47.490
But no one will need to say:
“Come on. Get up, Deli Demir.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:54.140
Who will make weapons for
the Alps of this tribe other than you?”

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.700
Isn’t this world a temporary moorland
for everyone, my loved one?

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.720
When the time comes, I shall join
the caravan that goes to the real home.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.400
We will meet then.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.130
Knowing this is enough for me, my love.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:28.030
The woman I saw the first time I opened my
eyes, the woman I gave my heart and loved.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.460
Until then, while you are under
this cold ground...

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.420
...I shall be feeling cold even
in front of the ironsmith’s fire.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.080
I wanted you to know that.
May God bless you.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.060
My sincere condolences, son.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.400
The world is like that.
An inn with two doors.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:07.440
Thank you,  Master Demir. The world is
the innkeeper, we are the travelers.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.860
Those who finish the number of breaths
given to them go under the ground.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.400
You are right, Bozok.
May God give you more patience.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.100
Anyway, see you in the tribe.
Peace be upon you.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.400
Peace be upon you, Master Demir.
May you have a good journey.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.620
-Yigit!
-Don’t move!

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.500
Drop down the axe or I will cut off his throat!

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.000
Tie him up.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.960
Halt!

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.430
We need to go faster, my Shahzada.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.420
She loses more blood
as the horse goes faster, Ertugrul.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.980
We shall rest here.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.600
Ertugrul and the rest...

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.430
...you caught them...

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.160
...right?

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.230
Sir, Ertugrul and others...

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.860
Did you let them escape?

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.920
Have mercy on me, sir.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.060
Gokce, put these ointments
in a place we can find easily.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.460
-We cannot waste time during the journey.
-Alright, mother.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.840
Selcan, don’t lift heavy things.
God forbid, you are already in pain.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.520
Do you know what I think?

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.780
It is not wise for you to stay back with
the caravan while you are pregnant.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.680
Come with us on this journey.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.420
Thank you, mother.
I do not know what Gundogdu would say.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.500
I do not think that he would oppose but...

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.040
...you are right, he is your Bey,
you should ask him.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.080
You take the arms rack.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.340
Gundogdu...

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.760
...Mother Hayme says...

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.940
...I do not want to worry,
you should come with us as well.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.320
She is worried after last night.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.340
How come?
What happened last night for her to worry?

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.540
Because of my cramps. She is afraid that
I would get tired in the caravan...

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.780
...and something might happen to the baby.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.300
You are staying here as well.
After last night, I would get worried too.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.120
I want you always to be by my sight.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.960
So you worry about your son and 
you want us to stay with you.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.020
As you wish, Gundogdu.
