00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,030
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,600
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,130
Father?

5
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,560
-Are you fine? Do you have any pain?
-Do not worry.

6
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,800
I am awake now. I will be up in no time.

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,430
Thank God.

8
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,230
Get well soon.

9
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,260
If you need anything Yigit can inform us.

10
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,130
Ertugrul. Yigit told me everything.

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,260
You and the people who raised
you are valiant people.

12
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,460
You saved and protected us.

13
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,430
We did what our customs order us to do.
There is no debt for that.

14
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,900
The people in these lands have long
forgotten their customs.

15
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,030
We must be God’s loved subjects for
someone like you to be there for us.

16
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,600
Please don’t say that.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,330
I should go. And you should rest.

18
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,200
Listen to me, Halime.
Find us some horses immediately.

19
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,230
Get prepared with your brother.
Don’t let anyone get suspicious.

20
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,100
What is happening, father?
What will we do?

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,260
We are going.

22
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
Halime, there is no other way.

23
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,100
If we stay for one more day,
we would endanger their lives as well.

24
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
I am going to the stable.

25
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Right before the headquarters,
where is this coming from, Gundogdu?

26
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,930
I am going to look at
the new horse they brought.

27
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,460
And you can start preparing
for the Aleppo journey.

28
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,860
I can make everything ready but...

29
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,830
...is it confirmed that
you will be going to Aleppo?

30
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,260
Don’t say that.

31
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,230
I was the one who put forth
the idea at the headquarters.

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,300
It is my right to be the envoy.

33
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,530
-Of course but...
-Of course but what?

34
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,360
Why are you worked up
so early in the morning, Selcan?

35
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,300
I don’t know whether I should worry about
the fact that you will be going or...

36
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,830
...the disappointment you will feel
if your father does not choose you.

37
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,400
Of course he will send me.
Who else can he send?

38
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,800
Hatun, look, if you are feeling sad
that I will be going...

39
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,460
...during the time I go and come back,
you can greet me with two lives.

40
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,800
When you are dealing with the horses in
the stable and me preparing you...

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,900
...provisions for the journey, you'd be
waiting for a very long time, Gundogdu.

42
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,400
I can check the horses after
the headquarters then.

43
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,960
Bey, do we have permission?

44
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,030
Come in, Hamza, come in.

45
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,430
-What happened?
-Bey, Suleyman Shah wants to see you.

46
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,260
In the name of God. In the name of God.

47
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,860
In the name of God.

48
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,600
In the name of God.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,030
I have decided that...

50
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,830
...Ertugrul will go to Aleppo.

51
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,860
Gundogdu.

52
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,260
I have some things to discuss with you.

53
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,300
Stay here.

54
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,030
Ertugrul, you go and prepare yourself.

55
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,400
Tell Ilyas Fakih that
he will be coming with you.

56
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,900
Come on!

57
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,000
Come on! Quick!

58
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,860
Faster, Turgut, faster! Come on!

59
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,860
Come on!

60
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,000
-I won!
-I won!

61
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,060
Don’t be ridiculous, I won!
I passed the line first!

62
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,030
-What are you saying?
-I was the first to pass the line!

63
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,460
Ask Aykiz!

64
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,330
Aykiz cannot be the referee.
She is your sweetheart.

65
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,530
How can you say this, Bamsi Beyrek?
When did I ever lie?

66
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,130
-I told you not to do that!
-What would you do if I do?

67
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,430
-Your brain is as big as a walnut.
-But I am a hard nut to crack!

68
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,260
Don’t be afraid! Come on then! Come on!

69
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,260
Stop right there! Stop!

70
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,430
What is wrong with Ertugrul?

71
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,430
Suleyman Shah called him to his tent.

72
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,330
-I wonder what the problem is.
-He is probably going gazelle hunting.

73
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,000
That gazelle deserved to be hunted.

74
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,130
Get ready. We are going to Aleppo.

75
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,400
Bamsi! We are going to Aleppo, Bamsi!

76
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
I was getting fat sitting all day!

77
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,960
Tell Ilyas Fakih as well,
he is coming with us.

78
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,560
I brought up the Aleppo idea.
I told you that El Aziz needed soldiers.

79
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,830
Why him and not me, father?

80
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,530
Because of this, son.

81
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,900
“I know. I can do. I said.”

82
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,330
When did arrogance grew inside you?

83
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,230
Am I the arrogant one?
The whole tribe is starving.

84
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,130
Famine is everywhere.
We could not even go on a foray.

85
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
Why?

86
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,100
-Because our Bey has a boil problem.
-Know your place!

87
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,300
Let it go, father. The whole tribe
complains about your old age.

88
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,800
-Brother?
-Get your hands off me!

89
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,930
Do you think it is your brother’s right
to be the ambassador?

90
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,530
Yes.

91
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
Why me and not my brother?

92
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,400
Because he started to worship
the flame of power. His soul is captured.

93
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,330
So I put out the flame.

94
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,860
Now, let us talk about
the flame within you.

95
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,030
Our guests will stay
with the tribe until you come back.

96
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,400
I am telling you this so that
you can focus on your mission.

97
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,300
Do not come back empty handed from Aleppo.

98
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,860
The future of Kayi is on your shoulders.

99
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,100
Your failure will mean
the calamity of all of us.

100
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,000
For the land El Aziz is going to give us,
we shall accept any price.

101
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,300
But not a single Oguz
is a sacrificial lamb.

102
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,600
Don’t you ever forget.
As much as you need a home near Aleppo...

103
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,600
...Ameer  of Aleppo needs Kayi’s Alps.

104
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,260
Do not ever bow your head down.
Show them that you are a real Oguz...

105
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,330
...who knows what he wants and
is ready to make a just deal.

106
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,260
May God help you.

107
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,200
I shall succeed in my duty
even if the cost is my life, father.

108
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,830
I shall be back to make you proud.

109
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,330
What happened?

110
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
Gundogdu!

111
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,460
-Gundogdu, stop! Stop!
-Leave me alone!

112
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,560
Friends, Alps!

113
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,030
Stop! Please!

114
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,230
Out! Get out!

115
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,860
Aren’t you going to talk?

116
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,260
Ambassador.
Ertugrul became the ambassador.

117
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,060
-I told you!
-Enough!

118
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,530
Take it! Drink.

119
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Drink this.

120
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,000
This must be Mother Hayme’s doing.

121
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,300
I don’t care less. It does not matter.
I know what I am going to do.

122
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,160
No! Please do not act in fury.

123
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,500
Those who act with fury always lose.

124
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,130
Enough, woman!
For the love of God, enough!

125
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,100
Finish your business.
Be ready with your Alps.

126
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,560
When that tactless brother of yours
messes everything up...

127
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,460
...you will get what you deserve.
And do not forget.

128
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,430
Angels of death wait for
the big day in the Bey’s marquee.

129
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,100
The news got stuck in my throat, Turgut.
I cannot swallow it...

130
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,600
...nor can I spit it out.

131
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,160
You talk like this is the first time
we will be apart, Aykiz.

132
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,460
When did we ever be together, Turgut?

133
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,430
Is waiting for the road at your father’s
tent and waiting for your man...

134
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,500
...in your husband’s tent be the same?

135
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,960
It is not the sorrow of separation
that is stuck in my throat...

136
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,330
...it is not being able to come together.

137
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,430
Anytime we talk about getting married,
it gets delayed for some reason.

138
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,960
I promise.
There will be no delay this time.

139
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,300
I don’t know whether
Aleppo will be a success or not but...

140
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,330
...the first wedding in our new land
will be ours. I promise you.

141
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,100
The drummers will cry out “Aykiz and
Turgut are finally getting married.”

142
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,560
All the girls in the weaving area
will say, “the most beautiful girl...

143
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,430
...of the tribe is getting married,
from now on it be our turn.”

144
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,500
When you leave Wild  Demir’s tent,
even the Sultan’s daughters will...

145
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,800
...get jealous of your beauty.

146
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,030
I wanted to say how sorry I am.
I do not know the words...

147
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,500
...that can describe this pain.
-Only you can understand me, Elanora.

148
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,230
Your father’s killers were
Muslims as well.

149
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,460
May you have a good journey, Titus.
Be careful.

150
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
I will be back, Elanora. See you soon.

151
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:16,930
You have witnessed a good commander
transform into a real Templar knight.

152
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
Revenge.
That was the only thing lacking in Titus.

153
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,060
If there is no revenge, a hay soldier
and a knight are no different.

154
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,400
Bisol’s death became Titus’ miracle.

155
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,400
May God forgive Bisol’s sins.

156
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,600
Looking at the presents, I can say that
Suleyman Shah realized the mistake he did.

157
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,160
Our Bey likes the Seljuk,
he respects them.

158
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,430
But only I can solve this issue,
Karatoygar.

159
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,100
The time limit I have put down
expires in the morning, Kurdoglu.

160
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,030
Or else the Seljuk’s wrath will burn
the whole Kayi tribe.

161
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,100
-You would burn with us, Karatoygar.
-How dare you?

162
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,560
Don’t tell me that
the Sultan knows about this.

163
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,100
Your manpower is not enough
to take them from Kayi by force.

164
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,200
You need to raise a whole army.

165
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,900
I am aware that you have armies
that are strong enough to crush Kayi.

166
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,330
You can do that. But first,
the Sultan would have to be informed.

167
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,330
And this would not suit you.
It would not suit us either.

168
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,060
I shall come to the point. For you and
the tribe to win at the same time...

169
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,330
...you need to hear what I have to say.

170
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,430
If you aim to cooperate...

171
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,600
...tell me. Who did this?

172
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,300
Was it Suleyman Shah?

173
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul.

174
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,300
Bamsi, Dogan.

175
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,360
The word is out about a journey.

176
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,430
When?

177
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,130
We shall set on the road to Aleppo
at the morning prayer.

178
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,230
Are you prepared?

179
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,130
The Alps are always ready for anything.

180
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,430
True. Everything seems easy
when you get used to it.

181
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,830
Sometimes it gets harder
when you get used to it.

182
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,530
May you have a good journey.

183
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,160
May the sun not burn you.

184
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,830
May you don’t get cold.

185
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,230
May your feet don’t touch a stone.
May you go like water...

186
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
...return to your tribe like water.

187
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,500
My horse shall fly me to
my destination and back to my tribe.

188
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,160
Your father and mother would be happy.

189
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,900
What about you?

190
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,100
Me?

191
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,600
I would be long gone.

192
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,400
You cannot go...

193
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,230
...before I come back.

194
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,260
Your father would not recover fully.

195
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,260
May you have a good journey, Ertugrul Bey.

196
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,900
All of us.

197
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,400
There is something I wonder.
Our involuntary guests...

198
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
...are they relatives of
Sultan Aladdin or something?

199
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,400
-That does not concern you!
-True. It does not concern me.

200
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,430
Come to the point. What is on your mind?

201
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,330
If you want to take what you want,
I shall have one small condition.

202
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,060
Ertugrul...

203
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,860
...whatever my late wife and Aykiz are...

204
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,930
...Halime and her family are the same
for me. Don’t you worry about them.

205
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,530
May God bless you, Wild  Demir.

206
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,600
May God bless you instead.
Trust makes a man grow.

207
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:35,930
You trusted me in this tribe,
you came to my door, you confided in me...

208
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,030
...that is why, may God bless you. Halime
and her family are my responsibility.

209
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,160
You can be rest assured.
Come on, may God be with you.

210
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,200
My son. My life.

211
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,430
My dear son...

212
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,530
...may your road
and fortune be always open.

213
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,230
The weight of Kayi is on your shoulders...

214
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:24,300
...never bow your head
nor give a promise you cannot keep.

215
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,100
May God give you a clear road.

216
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,560
You may be going and not coming back.

217
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,500
You may come back but not see me.

218
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,100
I will ride tirelessly to see you again.

219
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,200
May you have a clear road, Ertugrul.

220
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,000
While you were being punished for
rebelling against your father...

221
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,160
...the little Bey became the ambassador.

222
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,200
I knew you would come.

223
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,360
Welcome.

224
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,960
I don’t care about the prisoners,
Karatoygar.

225
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,530
They ran away in your territory.

226
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,460
We did our part.

227
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,430
Give me the name of the person
who killed my brother.

228
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,360
You are impatient to become a hangman.

229
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,560
Be careful, don’t let the noose of
the hangman get around you neck.

230
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,600
Don’t try to delegate
your own inaptitude to me.

231
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,130
The knights you brag about could not
deal with a few trifling Alps.

232
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,360
What do you want from me to give his name?

233
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,800
I will give you more than you want.

234
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,860
I will deliver him directly to you.

235
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,100
This is not an issue of business.

236
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,030
Do you understand me?
It is an assistance to a friend in pain.

237
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,330
We never let ourselves stay indebted
on any help we receive.

238
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,330
Alright.

239
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,300
Who?

240
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,300
Suleyman Shah’ son...

241
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,160
...Ertugrul.

242
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,560
Aykiz...

243
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,930
...can you look at these patterns as well?

244
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,230
I won’t be long.

245
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,130
When are you leaving?

246
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,160
When my father says so.

247
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,560
Do not try to stand strong.

248
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,930
People do not stay in a place
where they are not wanted.

249
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,130
If you have some sense of shame,
go at once.

250
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,360
It is customary.
You cannot say go to a guest.

251
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,600
That is why everyone keeps quiet.

252
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,960
And...

253
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,030
...will you paying your debt
to these people like this?

254
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,460
Is this what you deem proper for people
who gave you bread, their own tent...

255
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
...and dressed your wounds?

256
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,130
-I...
-You...

257
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,360
While you try to flirt around,
blood will be spilt in the tribe.

258
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,460
Blood. Go your own way.

259
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,800
Halime. Halime!

260
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,160
Selcan!

261
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,860
What did you tell the girl?

262
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,800
What she needed to hear.

263
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,530
Is it your duty to tell her
what she needs to hear?

264
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,830
I am thinking about
the future of the tribe.

265
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
That girl should have heard this long ago.

266
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,960
Such a shame.
Daugther of a Bey forgets our customs.

267
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,200
She talks on top of the words
of her forefathers.

268
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,000
Come to your senses, Selcan.

269
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,600
Otherwise, you might find yourself
under the stones you thought you crushed.

270
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,530
-What happened?
-Mind your own business!

271
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,400
Ertugrul has gone on a journey
with four Alps.

272
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,360
Eye for an eye. Devine justice.

273
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,160
-Where is he going?
-To Aleppo.

274
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,500
I shall take revenge with my own hands.

275
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,330
I can never let you do that, Titus.

276
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
Why?

277
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,430
These lands are my jurisdiction.

278
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,960
In my borders, only I can use force.

279
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,330
If it is heard that I made an alliance
with the crusaders to spill blood...

280
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,360
...our plan would fail.

281
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,460
This man killed my brother, Karatoygar.

282
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,230
I want you to bring him to me alive.

283
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
I shall take his life with my own hands.

284
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,130
Don’t you worry. I will present him to you
like a sacrificial ram.

285
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,600
Karatoygar is convinced, Bey.

286
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,400
He wanted us to look after them
until they get better.

287
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,200
Did you manage to learn who they are?

288
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,560
The pig’s son did not even utter
a single word about it.

289
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,600
If they made the great Seljuks stand up,
the issue must be serious.

290
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,600
Our part should be to benefit from this.

291
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,130
You asked for me, Bey.

292
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,530
If you don’t have anything else to say,
you must be very tired, go and rest.

293
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,130
Save me from this pest of a boil,
Akcakoca.

294
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,990
If God permits, Bey.

295
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,960
My death will be from this.

296
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,330
-Inform me of all developments.
-As you wish, Bey.

297
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,130
Everything is ready, father.

298
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,560
I have all the provisions ready,
we will be going tonight.

299
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,260
Don’t worry about your wound, I watched
Akcakoca very closely to see what he does.

300
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,030
Halime, calm down, my girl.

301
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,860
We will be running away from a place
we took refuge, as usual. That is all.

302
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,330
Is that all, father?

303
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,430
Is it only that for you?

304
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,230
I don’t know what goes through
your mind but...

305
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,830
...what makes this place
different for you?

306
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,530
Is there anything you are not telling me?

307
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
I am very tired, father.

308
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,300
I am tired of running away.

309
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,460
Let us start a new life.
Go some place where no one will find us.

310
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,060
Let us go beyond deserts and seas
but go from here, that is all I want.

311
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,930
Father?

312
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,060
What happened, son? What happened, Yigit?

313
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,600
We have a guest. He wants to come in.

314
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,260
Let him in.

315
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,100
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

316
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,000
Please.

317
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,230
Father, look. Wild  Demir made
a sword for you and my sister.

318
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,830
He is the best ironsmith in the region.
He makes the best swords.

319
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,200
Please don’t exaggerate, son.
Ours is only a pastime.

320
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,860
-These are yours.
-Thank you.

321
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,200
Don't mention it, my girl.

322
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,430
As Ertugrul Bey is not here,
I did not want you to be without weapons.

323
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,200
He would feel more comfortable.
I would do too.

324
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,460
Anyway, I am at my workshop
but my eye is on your tent.

325
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,430
If you need anything,
please do not hesitate.

326
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,260
What could happen in a big tribe?

327
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,030
Look, my girl.
Ertugrul Bey is like a son to me.

328
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,900
So I would never turn back his request.

329
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,300
This was not called for.

330
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,030
We will go this way.

331
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,860
Tell Ertugrul that horses should
rest a bit. They are exhausted.

332
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,830
His mind is with Halime.
He wants to return before they go.

333
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,300
If you have the courage, you tell him.

334
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,900
Bey.

335
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,060
Us being exhausted is not an issue
but the horses are very tired.

336
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,400
Bey, shall we rest a bit
beside the stream?

337
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,060
We can set camp down there.
We will set off before sunrise.

338
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,530
-Dogan, light a fire.
-As you wish, Bey.

339
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,030
Follow me quietly.

340
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,300
Peace be upon you.

341
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,900
And peace be upon you.

342
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,260
What happened to the gazelle?

343
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,230
We found it like this. It was probably
wounded while running away from a hunter.

344
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,860
I think that hunter was me.

345
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,860
If you let this game get away,
you must be a bad hunter.

346
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,260
I guess so.

347
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,200
Look at that beautiful face. So you
managed to escape from this big valiant.

348
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,100
Well done to you.
In the name of God, may you recover soon.

349
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,000
Come on now. Go. Go on.

350
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,830
Where do you come from and
where do you go?

351
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,260
We come from nowhere, to go anywhere.

352
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,830
What about you?

353
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,360
We are going to Aleppo.

354
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,160
Then you should always be alert.

355
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,830
Don’t become a hunt for
wolves and vultures.

356
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,100
The air here is very hazy.
Don’t be lost in the haze.

357
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,530
Will you grant me your name?

358
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,460
Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.
