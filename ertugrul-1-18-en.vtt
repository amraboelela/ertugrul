RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.000
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.400
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.030
Thank you, despite everything, Kurdoglu.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.260
What if you were late?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.330
God has spared our Bey’s life to us ,
Wild Demir. The rest is not important.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.230
Well?

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.330
What will you do now?
Will you come with us to Aleppo?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.130
No, I have to return. I cannot leave
the tribe alone in a migration journey.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.560
You are with our Shah, Wild Demir.
I know he is in good hands.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.500
Thank you.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.130
See you in Aleppo.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.960
This is Turgut’s axe!

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.200
And this is Shahzade’s necklace.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.100
What are they doing here, Bey?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.930
Sit down.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.100
I will tell you everything.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.860
AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.900
Yigit...

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.330
...do not let yourself down.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.360
Patience is bitter but its fruit is sweet.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.600
Alright, my lion?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.460
I am fine, Turgut Aga.
I am only a bit tired.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.500
Well done, my boy.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.100
Why did you chain the Shahzade?
Untie him quick.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.360
My Shahzade, your cap.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.030
Have some water.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.430
These crass savages have been tactless.
Having a Shahzade like you...

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.060
...breath the same air
with a shepherd is shameful.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.860
Would you like me to wash your face,
Shahzade?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.560
I am Cardinal Thomas.
I come from the Papacy.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.230
I am always ready to assist you.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.600
I could not sleep all night because of
how these miserable people treated you.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.560
I have arranged a special room for you.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.400
I would like to serve the best I can
to host you in a manner deserving of...

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.460
...the royal blood you carry.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.900
What about Turgut Aga?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.430
Do not worry about him.
They will take good care of him.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.400
Shall we go, Shahzade? Please.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.100
But...

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.360
...we have another big trouble
awaiting us.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.260
It is obvious that the things I told
Sahabettin has not been heard by El Aziz.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.130
Today El Aziz,
tore off the agreement saying that...

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.530
...there is plague in our tribe.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.030
This means that the caravans
don’t have a home to migrate to.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.160
Aleppo! Aleppo! May the ground split
and take you in, Aleppo!

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.430
This is not the time to cry and frown.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.530
I understand that Sahabettin fell victim
to a plot of the Templars.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.600
Otherwise he would not have left me
alone in that palace no matter what.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.160
What do you propose, Ertugrul Bey?
What is on your mind?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.160
We have to learn
what happened to Sahabettin.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.230
The vizier is the only person
who can help us reach Yigit and Turgut...

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.930
...as well as solve
this issue of our homeland.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.060
We cannot leave him to the mercy of
the Crusader infidels.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.100
Where are we going?

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.160
We are going to watch a ceremony where
youngsters like you turn to real heroes.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.030
Father...

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.500
...Son...

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.260
...and The Holy Ghost.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.160
Father...

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.330
...Son...

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.130
...and The Holy Ghost.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.260
Have they become Alps now?

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.830
They have become invincible warriors,
more powerful and braver than the Alps.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.960
My governess...

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.600
...I am really worried about my uncle.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.930
Can he be in some sort of trouble?

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.030
You are not hiding anything
from me, are you?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.100
My beautiful girl,
when did I ever hide anything from you?

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.230
Do not worry. I sent the maids.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.030
We will get good news from
our vizier soon, if God permits.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.130
If God permits, governess.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.800
Look, whatever the news,
you shall tell me the truth. Promise me.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.460
Leila, do not worry.
I told you that I would.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.930
Promise me, governess.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.230
God give me patience. Alright. I promise.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.430
Do not be sad, Esma.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.560
We set out a trap but could not succeed.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.330
I did not realize that the infidels were
within us and they held my nephew...

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.560
...in their hands.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.500
Who do you suspect, Efendi?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.330
I did not consider him at first but...

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.830
...Nasir.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.800
Do not be scared. Do not be afraid.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:36.430
My brave Esma. There is no one
I can trust in the palace apart from you.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.530
What can I do for you, Efendi?

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.060
Just order.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.100
You need to find someone
and bring him here for me.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.560
His name is Ertugrul.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.060
My uncle.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.360
Did she bring the news?

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.030
Calm down, Leila. You will get ill.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.260
I am calm, governess. You promised me.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.000
You shall tell me straight up.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.260
Is my uncle well?

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.300
Vizier Sahabettin has been arrested.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.000
He is to be tried.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.860
Who did this and why?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.900
Leila, calm down.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.160
Your brother.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.530
Your uncle was arrested on
the orders of your brother Ameer El Aziz.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.800
Leila, Leila.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.460
You need to be calm. Come and sit here.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.530
Come on, my girl.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.100
Calm down. You need to be calm.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.360
Brother. I have to see my brother.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.060
Governess, I have to save my uncle.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.030
Do I understand you correctly?

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.230
This man called you smooth faced...

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.260
...and you got angry.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.830
Yes, your highness.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.260
But you cannot grow a beard.
Why do you get angry?

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.860
Anyway, you tell me.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.500
-Your highness, this smooth face came...
-That is not appropriate.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.430
In my presence, in the presence of
Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz...

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.030
...you shall both watch your manners.
Now talk.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.030
Efendi, this man came and...

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.400
...plucked my beard, Efendi.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.960
Is that all?

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.160
-Nasir.
-Yes, your highness?

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.100
Throw both of them to the dungeon.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.830
They shall stay in the dungeon
until the smooth face grows a beard.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.600
When the smooth face grows a beard,
the man whose beard was plucked...

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.430
...shall pluck the beard of smooth face
to exercise the right to eye for an eye.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.300
And this problem shall be solved.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.200
-Let me go, your highness!
-Let me go! I beg you, let me go!

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.860
-Please spare us.
-Let me go! Let me go!

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.030
Nasir? Are these real?

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.500
Or did you arrange
this visit day to entertain me?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.900
Please know that I have no contribution
at all, your highness.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.000
Your subjects came to take refuge
in your justice.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.260
My dear Nasir...

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.600
...why didn’t you tell me that
these state issues are so boring.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.930
Your highness.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.260
Leila Sultan.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.200
I do not understand.
What happened to Leila Sultan?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.200
She is not well. They wait for you.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.930
I have just seen Sahabettin.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.130
He suspects you.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.330
Peace be upon you.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.300
My dear Afsin Bey.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.800
When they said that they saw you in the
streets of Aleppo, I did not believe them.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.560
So the youngsters realized that
I was following them.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.530
You raised them well.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.560
But I am surprised. Is there anyone
left in the youngsters who know me?

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.060
Please.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.860
Your fame precedes you, Afsin Bey.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.500
And the ones who don’t know,
we tell what a valiant man you are.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.800
Do not say that.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.460
But we talked about you, we tell
the youngsters that you are a martyr.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.360
But you are as alive as us.
We were just creating a myth.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.130
Is there any news about
the wise man in Ahlat, Aykutluk.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.030
It has been a while since
I have to Ahlat and talk with them.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.800
But the news we received is not nice.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.300
They say that the path taken
by the Seljuk dynasty is not right.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.830
Taking Sultan Aladdin from the Konya
palace and burning down the rest...

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.130
...would not be a sin, they say.
I do not know what will happen.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.300
When a cloud covers the crescent,
they say the night is dark, Aykutluk.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.200
But everything depends on a wind.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.400
The crescent shall shine again,
you can be rest assured about that.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.960
Anyway, I want something else from you.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.430
Listen closely.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.930
Inform all your ears and eyes
in the streets of Aleppo.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.830
We need to learn
the fate of Vizier Sahabettin.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.160
Thank you.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.460
Leila? My sister?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.900
Brother, where is our uncle?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.530
The starry night of Aleppo, Leila.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.130
Why do you worry, my dear sister?

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.600
He did not visit me for days.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.360
He never neglected me before.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.000
Are the things I heard true?

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.000
My Leila.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.560
The ache of my heart.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.200
Why do you make a fuss over my uncle?

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.930
He must be drowned in state work.
He would visit you in a few days.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.100
Tell me the truth, brother!
Are the things I heard true?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.100
Is my uncle in prison?

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.430
When a slight breeze passes,
you tremble like a dry leaf.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.030
Your innocent heart cannot bear
the ugliness of the world.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.060
You would be bedridden
like a wilting rose.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.300
My precious sister...

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.360
...do not think about our uncle.
-Brother. Is it true?

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.600
Our uncle Sahabettin...

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.230
...engaged in things not befitting to him.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.100
Unfortunately,
what you heard is true, my sister.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.330
I do not believe that.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.960
How can you believe such a thing?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.960
Our uncle would never attempt a bad thing.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.000
You are mistaken, my innocent sister.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.830
Our precious uncle...

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.960
...our wise vizier...

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.930
...collaborated with the killers
of our father, the Templar Knights.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.930
Leila, Leila.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.600
Leila.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.330
Leila! Leila!

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.900
I told your request to our people,
Afsin Bey. We will hear something soon.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.460
Shall we drink some sherbet
and rest until then?

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.060
Ertugrul?

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.500
Tell me, my Sultan.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.460
Do not worry about me.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.030
I shall be fine.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.960
I know.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.460
But I burn inside as I see you in pain.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.030
You risked your own life to save me.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.100
What if something happened to you?

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.160
But it did not. I am fine.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.460
When I opened my heart to you that day...

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.460
...you denied it. You are ready to
sacrifice yourself but...

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.100
...you refrain from
telling me what is in your heart.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:41.160
When a girl knows that
she cannot attain her worldly love...

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.100
...she yearns to reach the Godly love.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.100
Ertugrul you always told me the truth.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.030
I beg you not to hide
the truth from me now.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.130
I know it is not a good sign
that they are so delayed.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.300
Is there any news about Yigit and Turgut,
Ertugrul?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.560
-Yes.
-Tell me the truth, Ertugrul.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.300
Did something happen to my brother?

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.460
The Templars...

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.500
...took them as prisoners.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.800
Don’t.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.300
Yigit must be devastated. Ertugrul...

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.160
Ertugrul, I beg you, save Yigit.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.460
I promise you, Halime.
I will bring your brother back to you.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.900
Hatun.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.330
You shall be a bit uncomfortable but...

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.200
...when we think about the long time
you shall be spending with us...

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.200
...it is best for everyone
that your paws are under control.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.300
-Where did you take the boy?
-Don’t you worry about him.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.200
You can be rest assured that
we will look after him very well.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.500
He is an innocent boy.
What do you want from him?

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.830
Do whatever you want to do to me!

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.030
Why do you think that we treat him badly?

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:55.400
Cardinal Thomas who came here
is looking after him personally.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.160
You should have seen them while
they were watching the knights.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.460
In the eyes of the small Shahzade,
there was a sparkle that is befitting...

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.230
...of the poor warriors of Jesus.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.330
Welcome, my princess.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.900
Where is Elanora?

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.600
Why didn’t my sister come out to greet me?

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.100
Ma’am, Ustad is waiting for you.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.000
He shall inform you about
this matter as well.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.330
Isadora!

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.930
My dear niece.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.900
You are here at last.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.400
I missed you very much, dear uncle.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.800
But my sweet sister is still
nowhere to be seen.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.000
Didn’t she miss me?

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.400
But she was urging me to come as soon as
possible in the letter she wrote to me.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.830
Where is Elanora, uncle?

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.360
-Governess?
-I am here, Leila.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.430
Close the curtains, governess.
There is too much light inside.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.560
My dear girl...

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.260
...if you could get up and walk a bit,
if you could eat something...

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.360
...you would regain your strength.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.530
You did not eat anything the whole day.
I am really worried about you, Leila.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.600
Close the curtains, governess.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.960
Is there any news, Afsin Bey?

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.900
What is his situation?

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.160
The news is not very good, Ertugrul Bey.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.100
Sahabettin Tugrul is arrested.
He is in Aleppo dungeons.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.530
What is the reason?

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.260
What is he accused with?

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.130
The accusation is not known, Ertugrul Bey.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.830
But yesterday Chief of Guard Nasir
and Melik El Aziz were seen...

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.800
...taking something out.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.530
There was a maid from
the palace with them as well.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.560
It might be something to do
with the vizier.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.860
Are you better now, Isadora?

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.530
How did it happen, uncle?

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.230
How did my beautiful sister die?

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.000
You know that...

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.100
...Elanora never accepted
his father’s death.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.560
And this thought had started
to affect her health.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.230
Maybe she mentioned this to you
in her letters.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.360
Mad girl.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:58.430
She had a wild idea that
your father was in the dungeon.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:05.300
She insisted to go there and started
to create ridiculous excuses to go there.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:11.300
And she did not want understand
how dangerous the dungeon was for her.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.000
I forbade her to go there.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.260
But...

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.000
...a day when I was not in the castle...

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.530
Did she go down the dungeon?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.030
One of the ferocious convicts...

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.900
...in the hope of that he might escape...

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.930
...killed our innocent Elanora.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.430
-Is that convict still alive?
-No.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:50.300
He was executed,
just like the guards who let her go in.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.960
Elanora’s death was avenged
in a suitable manner.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.160
She is very tame, Efendi.

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:42.400
But she knows her job well.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.300
One of the most beautiful girls
we have, Efendi.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.860
-How is this one?
-She can stay.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.100
This one is a genuine pearl.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.430
Words are not enough
to describe her beauty.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:05.560
She is intelligent, skillful, educated.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.400
She has a beautiful voice as well.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.900
She can sing, recite poems
and dances beautifully.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.430
Those who watch her dance are enchanted.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:33.560
You can arrange the rest.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.030
You know how this axe is made, right?

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.100
Yes.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.300
I know well.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:42.530
A heap of steel becomes an axe
blow by blow, beaten up endlessly.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:45.860
Well...

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.500
...do you know how miners makes the metal
and how leather man makes leather?

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.030
If this piece of leather on you
didn’t get beaten blow by blow...

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.860
...it would have become
a piece of garbage.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:10.300
If it wasn’t fired, the metal in your
sword would still be a rock somewhere.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.900
What about you, Ertugrul?

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.560
What would happen if you were not tested?
Do you know that?

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.430
The problem is not only me being tested.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.000
My friends,
my battle comrades, my family...

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.100
...my tribe who trusted me.
The vizier who wanted to help me.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.830
They are all in great difficulties
because of me.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.000
The pain caused by this
is burning my soul.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.060
Existence is a school, son.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.460
Everyone is a student.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.530
And God is the only Teacher.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:39:00.430
He manifests His Titles and test us.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.360
But distress or blessing,
mercy or trouble is always from Him.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.560
Everyone lives their own exam.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:15.300
You need to be one of the people who pass
the exam and submit yourself to Him.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:22.030
Then you would be the greatest warrior
and the greatest hero.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.860
Is sitting around like this
a test as well?

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.360
God likes submission, son, not imprudence.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.900
If a brother is in a bad situation...

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:43.560
...submission is to look for a way
to get him out, without forgetting God.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.500
Come on, get up.
Test of a valiant is not easy.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.230
And a valiant should not stop.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.560
Her room.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:14.800
-If you don’t want to stay here...
-On the contrary, I want to stay here.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.830
You are very tired.
Rest well tonight, Isadora.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.330
Good night, my girl.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.830
Good night.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.400
Bey...

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.560
...I am the private maid of
Vizier Sahabettin Tugrul.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.030
My name is Esma, he sent me here.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.230
How do I know that Sahabettin sent you?

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.360
He told me to say “a man’s word is said
directly to a man’s face” and that...

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.200
...you would know, Bey.
He wants to talk face to face with you.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.530
All state matters are left to you,
your highness.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.960
And I thought that you have
a right to enjoy life a bit.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.960
I hope that I was not tactless.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.960
How will you take me in?

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:53.000
There is a secret passage that goes
to the dungeons. My vizier told me.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.930
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:20.830
