00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:45,000
The inspiration of the story and characters in this series is our history.

00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,769
No animals were harmed in the making of this film.

00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:16,507
[They get strength from Allah's name while forging iron]

7
00:02:29,912 --> 00:02:32,201
Even the iron couldn't resist our words and gained faith.

8
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:34,142
Wait a bit...

9
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:48,022
Take a look at this, if you'd like, eh?

10
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,678
how magnificent! (maşallah)

11
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,730
I feel sorry for the enemy whom's life will be taken by this sword.

12
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:05,116
May a brave man like you be the voice and wrath to those who act unfairly. (inşallah)

13
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:08,374
(<i>note: inşallah means hoping something with God's will</i>)

14
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,432
There is no sword like the Zulfiqar... and there is no soldier like Ali was...

15
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:13,432
(<i>note: Ali ibn Abu Talib is an Islamic historical person, known as a great soldier with his famous sword the Zulfiqar.</i>)

16
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:15,930
I love the God who created a man like you.

17
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,702
It will be honor to carry this sword for the love of Allah
and in the name of my ancestor Oğuz.

18
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,529
(<i>note: Oğuz are ancient Turkic and/or Uygur tribes. meaning literally "tribe".</i>)

19
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,529
Come on, show me your hands.

20
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:53,099
What's up? Your men are acting all energetic again.

21
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:56,288
We're going out hunting.

22
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:59,114
They are getting ready.

23
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,910
Is there any animal left to become prey in this land?

24
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:09,205
You are right, but...

25
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,471
What makes warriors united is hunting.

26
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:17,194
It would be better if we could find a solution to keep the tribe united.

27
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,700
That solution will only come from tomorrow's meeting.

28
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:24,301
If we don't migrate from this highland before winter,
we all will be in great trouble.

29
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:30,102
But, if you have a solution, let us know as well. Eh?

30
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:33,449
My brother Gündoğdu is better with these subjects.

31
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,025
You can talk with him, if you want to.

32
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,117
Gündoğdu?

33
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:37,066
(<i>sniggering</i>)

34
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,426
No way. He doesn't breathe a word of it.

35
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,925
So this is what you spend 40 akçes on?

36
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,605
This is called a map.

37
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:58,020
What is it good for?

38
00:04:58,866 --> 00:04:59,750
Now look...

39
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:01,975
We are here.

40
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,073
...right where these mountains are.

41
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:07,313
This is Aleppo.

42
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,977
This is Bagdat.

43
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:11,186
And this is Damascus.

44
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:14,525
And this is Konya where Sultan's palace is located.

45
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,478
Nevermind where sultans' or the nobles' palaces are...

46
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,796
Just tell me where this tribe will migrate, Gündoğdu.

47
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:25,846
Beys can't think clearly. Your father hasn't said anything.

48
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,050
He just perches like a sad owl in his tent.

49
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:34,128
(<i>note: a Bey is a title used as a chieftain, or a leader of a tribe. but can also mean something like sir/mister/lord. Which one of the meaning is used can also vary per situation. </i>)

50
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,522
Where is this place?

51
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:42,390
Everyone will learn at the meeting tomorrow.

52
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:44,242
You found it, didn't you?

53
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:47,421
Come on, tell me where is it? Huh?

54
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,937
Ertuğrul!

55
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,730
Ertuğrul!

56
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,311
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

57
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,039
I AM GOING HUNTING.

58
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,940
COULDN'T YOU PICK ANOTHER TIME?
WE HAVE A MEETING TOMORROW.

59
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,783
THE MEETING IS YOURS, AND THE HUNT IS MINE, BROTHER!

60
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:20,961
THANK YOU. DON'T GO TOO FAR...
GO FAST! COME BACK QUICKLY.

61
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:41,575
What's up, Bamsı? What's with that pastrami?

62
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,305
We are going hunting. Have you forgotten that?

63
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,955
We won't let you starve during the hunting; don't you worry.

64
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:48,557
Turgut, you can't call a man as a brave man
if he starves during the hunting.

65
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,169
It is just to boost our ego's during our trip.

66
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,810
We're screwed if we are going to boost your ego.

67
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:58,844
Come on warriors!

68
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:00,978
Yours (crush) is leaving.

69
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:40,879
Amanos Mountains
Knights Templar Castle

70
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,201
THE WATCH...

71
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,779
... IS YOUR HONOR!

72
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,679
THE WATCH IS YOUR HONOR!

73
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:55,637
IF YOU WALK OVER YOUR HONOR AND VIRTUE,
INSTEAD OF YOUR ENEMY...

74
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,329
YOU WON'T DIE BY THE ENEMY'S HAND, BUT BY MINE!

75
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,386
It's an honor to have you here Grand Master.

76
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,244
The honor is ours...

77
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,900
Elenora...

78
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:02,983
Commander Titus...

79
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,626
I hope you had a good trip.

80
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,570
Is everything alright, Titus?

81
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,975
We are safer than ever before, sir.

82
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,478
Your rooms are ready, sir,
Would you like to get some rest before the dinner?

83
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:22,227
Elenora can get some rest but we have things to do, Commander.

84
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:24,822
As you wish.

85
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:26,420
If you'll excuse me...

86
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,743
What is the status of the prisoners?

87
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:55,008
I put my brother Bisol in charge.

88
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:01,371
They will deliver Numan and his family to Kara Toygar.

89
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,268
I've been waiting for you for the rest.

90
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,178
That's great...

91
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,830
Where are they taking us, dad?

92
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,233
To our palace, son.

93
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:46,240
Then, we will be freed there, right?

94
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,919
Forever, son, forever...

95
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,182
It seems, it was our destiny to return to Konya like this.

96
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:04,673
To die in the palace where were born and raised... by our uncle's hand.

97
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:08,349
Daughter, I will not allow anything to happen to you and your brother.

98
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:34,099
Kara Toygar will be tied to us entirely after this move.

99
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:38,810
It is very important that he wins Sultan Alaaddin's favor.

100
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:45,723
We will be able to catch our breath once Kara Toygar
is assigned to a high level position in the Selçuk' palace.

101
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,327
KARATOYGAR CARAVANSARY

102
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:49,977
We did everything as you requested, sir.

103
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,390
OK!

104
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,880
Commander!

105
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,154
Are Turkmen Tribes paying their taxes?

106
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:01,591
We can't control them, sir. They are constantly moving.

107
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,021
Which tribe is the largest?

108
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,266
Kayi Tribe, sir.

109
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,712
They were driven here because of the Mongolian invasion.

110
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:08,793
- Who is its leader?
- Suleyman Shah.

111
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:12,563
- How many tents?
- 2000. But, they are very well maintained.

112
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:15,312
- Do they pay their taxes?
- They do, sir.

113
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,432
Great.

114
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,338
Then, have them pay their taxes early this year.

115
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,232
But, sir...

116
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:25,343
You heard what I said.

117
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,553
How will this country stay on it's feet otherwise?

118
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:30,044
Inform all the tribes within the region right away!

119
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,517
Yes, my commander.

120
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:37,853
Why are these Knights Templar so late?

121
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:44,663
STOP!

122
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,831
Let's get some rest here.

123
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,429
Stay on watch around.

124
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,839
We have to break the strength of the Selçuks before the crusade.

125
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:13,243
Titus, you need to place more men into the Selçuk' Palace.

126
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:20,308
You can be sure that we will get hold of the entire palace.

127
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,366
Some people in the Vatican don't want to start the crusades.

128
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,600
I am not suprised at all.

129
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,291
We have to make a plan to bring entire Europe into action.

130
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,573
We have to succeed in this.

131
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:38,733
The crusaders must unite and act to capture Jerusalem.

132
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:43,924
To do this, we must provoke Muslims and incur their anger.

133
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:46,402
I have very precious prisoners.

134
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,778
We can start with them.

135
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:56,175
Shush... Calm down boy.

136
00:14:56,975 --> 00:14:57,795
Yiğit.

137
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,144
Filthy runt.

138
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:04,084
Go to hell.

139
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,859
Just get us there as soon as possible...

140
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,396
Do you want to die so soon, eh?

141
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:15,166
I feel sorry for your beautiful daughter and your young şehzade (prince).

142
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,856
Don't get so upset for us.

143
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:21,303
If you allied with us, you could have become the Selçuk' sultan.

144
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,509
And we were going to move on.

145
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,495
You offered me to be pope's slave.

146
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:30,073
We offered you peace and a new world order.

147
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:32,935
We wanted to be together.

148
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:34,525
But...

149
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:37,860
Muslim blood will shed.

150
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:40,606
You won't be able to escape this.

151
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:46,440
And it will be our allied muslim friends, who will help us shed your bloods.

152
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,379
You won't succeed.

153
00:15:49,943 --> 00:15:51,512
We will see how it ends.

154
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:55,470
By the way, tell the men of yours I send to hell...

155
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,794
my regards.

156
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,723
The area is safe, sir.

157
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,249
Good, give the horses water.

158
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:05,613
...and them, too.

159
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,892
You two... Sit somewhere else.

160
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:53,781
I brought you water. Take it.

161
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:06,018
Take it...

162
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,654
Come on...

163
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,240
- There is nobody coming,
- The key... Take the key...

164
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,666
Come on daughter...

165
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,604
Hurry up!

166
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,366
Look, this is our fortune.

167
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,847
The prisoners are escaping!

168
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:39,034
- Run!
- Catch them!
- Run!

169
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,620
- Father! 
- Father!

170
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,710
- Father, are you alright?
- Father?

171
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,392
Hurry up! Take your brother and go!

172
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:48,271
No!

173
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:16,910
Father!

174
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:21,487
Hurry up! Run!

175
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:22,900
- Go!
- Father!

176
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,940
I said,take your brother and run...

177
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,580
Father...

178
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,112
Come on father, get up! Come on!

179
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,901
Escaping, eh? I'll show you!

180
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,561
Father...

181
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,485
Father!

182
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,967
Help God, Help!

183
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:06,204
- Father!
- Father!

184
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:24,614
-We need to stop the bleeding!-

185
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,706
Your fortune was the crusaders.

186
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,152
Hold on... Hold on, father.

187
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,389
Turgut... Oak leaves... - Yes my bey.

188
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:19,849
If we succeed, the borders of this entire geography will change.

189
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:26,554
We shouldn't hesitate to spend fortunes of our brethren for our liberation of Jerusalem's.

190
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:29,958
We are ready to spend all the wealth.

191
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:36,953
An expedition to Jerusalem is the easiest way to get rich for young men.

192
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:41,762
They will massively join the crusaders army to be its soldier

193
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:46,674
Catalans... Venetians,.

194
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:48,566
People of Marseilles...

195
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:53,242
All of them will want to be a part of this carnival.

196
00:26:54,652 --> 00:26:59,070
Well... These spoiled princes of Europe...

197
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:01,865
How will we trust them?

198
00:27:03,062 --> 00:27:05,905
While muslims are fighting with each other...

199
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:08,406
...our job will be easier this time, Titus.

200
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:09,984
What about the Selçuks, my master?

201
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:17,120
Anatolia... is having its best days under the rule of Sultan Alaaddin.

202
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:27,998
We will reach our goal once we play the Turks against Selahaddin Eyyubi's descendants.

203
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,082
Jerusalem will be ours.

204
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:12,447
Okay, father. It's nearly done father.

205
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:16,771
Okay.

206
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:23,425
Let's head out as soon as possible.

207
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:25,960
You go.

208
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,536
We can take care of ourselves.

209
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,812
It's going to get dark soon.

210
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:34,379
Probably, coyotes have already smelled the blood.

211
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,496
Bamsı Beyrek... ... Doğan.

212
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,120
Bring the horses.

213
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:47,377
It's easy to defeat a couple of crusaders. Here we go...

214
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,196
Ertugrul is really going to get in trouble now.

215
00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:51,488
God watches over those in trouble my brother.

216
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:53,410
He is in great trouble.

217
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,398
Come on.

218
00:28:57,772 --> 00:28:59,268
What can you even do on your own?

219
00:28:59,524 --> 00:29:01,328
I said we are not coming.

220
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,616
We owe you our lives.

221
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,695
We will pay back one day. Tell me your name.

222
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,219
Ertuğrul from the Kayi tribe.

223
00:29:13,674 --> 00:29:15,008
As you wish.

224
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,752
May God help you. Good luck.

225
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:22,542
Please, let's go with them.

226
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,262
Is your encampment too far?

227
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:43,242
(<i>hammering</i>)

228
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,196
We are out of our (critical) reserve money, brother Afşin.

229
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:14,355
We set up our shop here. If our business doesn't sell, then we will depart as soon as possible.

230
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:19,077
- Peace be upon you. Have a nice day,
- Peace be upon you too, Welcome.

231
00:30:40,092 --> 00:30:42,086
Welcome, Gazanfer Ağa. (<i>Ağa meaning senior</i>)

232
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:44,173
It's a pleasure to see you here at the Kayi's.

233
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:46,267
Hey, my brother Kurdoglu.

234
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,493
You seem to be in good shape, how wonderful (thank God).

235
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:51,317
This environment doesn't keep people alive. How can I look alive, Gazanfer?

236
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:54,481
No, don't say that. You look good, wonderful (<i>note: maşallah means praise be to God</i>) .

237
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:59,506
- Where is your caravan?
- My caravan is waiting at Karakaya.

238
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:04,217
I came here to get permission from Süleyman Shah to set up a shop at the bazaar.

239
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:07,585
- How is your business,
- I thank for what God bestowed.

240
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:11,332
I just wanted to meet the needs of Kayi before it migrates.

241
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:14,161
Thank you Gazanfer. I hope you find what you expected.

242
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:16,359
Thanks.

243
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:20,461
I want to visit Suleyman Shah if he is available.

244
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:24,413
Let him know that Gazanfer Aga is here!

245
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,768
- How many akçe is this? - He is mute sir, let me help you.

246
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:49,657
80 akçe.

247
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,669
You are very familiar.

248
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,967
This is my first visit to your encampment. I guess you confuse me with someone else.

249
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,508
Peace be upon you Süleyman Shah.

250
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:23,395
And peace be upon you, trader.

251
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:26,386
Welcome. It's a pleasure to see you. Come in.

252
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,454
Suleyman Bey, just let me say how happy my eyes are to see you once again.

253
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,115
Please accept my gifts, my bey.

254
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:41,591
I brought these for you from Constantinople.

255
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,295
Why did you bother?

256
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,744
Kurdoğlu...

257
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:50,681
Give these to those who need them.

258
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:52,014
Yes, my bey.

259
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:53,939
And?

260
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:57,145
Tell me what those eyes of yours saw in other lands.

261
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:59,793
If wish I was deaf and didn't hear what happened.

262
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:02,529
I wish my eyes were carved out and didn't see what happened, sir.

263
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:04,733
What's wrong, I hope it's fortunate ?

264
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:08,735
Sultan Alaaddin has created order in Konya .

265
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,434
However, he is afraid that runaway princes can cause trouble.

266
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,675
The Latins ruined Constantine.

267
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,893
All of the Orthodoxes are leaving the city.

268
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:21,638
There is corruption and no peace... And on top of that, people are very desperate because of the drought.

269
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:25,506
We've heard that surviving crusaders were on the boil.

270
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:29,299
Obviously, they are up to no good.

271
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,854
Well...

272
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:32,676
What about the crusaders?

273
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,831
They will be on the move again to fill their needs.

274
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:41,568
Sir, there are rumors that the Pope is calling all princes in Europe for the crusades.

275
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:47,450
And we, Muslims, are busy with fighting with each other and sowing discord among us.

276
00:33:48,424 --> 00:33:50,753
And add fuel to the fire of sedition.

277
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,268
There is fire everywhere from Anatolia to Basra.

278
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,294
This fire will affect us as well, my bey.

279
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,315
Sir, please don't say "fire". It makes me fee unwell.

280
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:01,904
I am here to get your approval to sell my goods in the encampment, my bey.

281
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:04,644
I approve it.

282
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:06,255
Thank you.

283
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,445
Kara Toygar has come to the region to knock some sense into Turkmen nomads.

284
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:22,983
So, difficult times are ahead of us.

285
00:34:29,582 --> 00:34:32,068
This girl is from Venice; Rosalina.

286
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:35,133
She is a noblewoman. White skin... Green eyes...

287
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,670
Women like her are very rare, Commander.

288
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,913
On top of that, she is a bargain. I am hard pressed these days.

289
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:43,514
This is a golden opportunity for both of us.

290
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:49,769
What about her, Commander?

291
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:51,687
She was kidnapped from Greek Islands.

292
00:34:51,886 --> 00:34:53,928
She is very young and beautiful.

293
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,205
She is like a wild mare.

294
00:34:57,115 --> 00:34:59,865
I trained her myself. She is for masters with refined taste.

295
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,161
What about that blonde one?

296
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,509
I have to say that you are very tasteful, Commander.

297
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,301
I bought her from the survivors of the crusaders

298
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,585
They brought her on a ship. She is Serbian. She knows very well how to serve men.

299
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:13,748
Silence.

300
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:16,739
Come here.

301
00:35:32,543 --> 00:35:35,513
You don't have to be afraid of me.

302
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,993
I am your master now.

303
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:45,431
Commander, you chose the most expensive one.

304
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:46,905
But she's worth it.

305
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:57,841
- My lord...
- What happened?

306
00:35:58,262 --> 00:35:59,734
The crusaders...

307
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:01,640
The crusaders were attacked.

308
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:05,441
And you did not save them?

309
00:36:06,112 --> 00:36:07,733
We were too late, my lord.

310
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:10,638
You couldn't save them, eh???

311
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,373
Akçakoca!

312
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:11,895
We have a wounded!

313
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:12,931
Bamsı!

314
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,215
Take the wounded.

315
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:26,945
My Turgut, what happened?

316
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,100
- There is nothing to worry about,
- You're alright, right?

317
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:31,878
Thank God, all of us are fine.

318
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:47,861
Ertugrul...

319
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,829
What's going on, brother?

320
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:53,622
We were attacked, brother.

321
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:55,301
I'll tell you later.

322
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,826
Hamza, keep an eye on them.

323
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:09,604
Yes, sir.

324
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,489
Who are they, Gundogdu?

325
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,864
I don't know, our bey (<i>sarcasm</i>) said he will tell it later.

326
00:38:18,904 --> 00:38:20,693
We'll find out soon.

327
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,808
Sister, what happened? Who are they?

328
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,843
We will find out very soon.

329
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:41,928
The sword cut is right under his rib.

330
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:45,140
Luckily, the oak leaf stopped the bleeding.

331
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,226
Otherwise, he could have died.

332
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,441
Midwife, bring hot water immediately.

333
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:52,004
Right away, Akçakoca.

334
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:56,448
His leg is bad, too.

335
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,119
But, let's take care of this wound first.

336
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:01,239
Akçakoca will handle the rest.

337
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,476
Let's wait at the other room.

338
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,116
Sister, let's not leave our father alone.

339
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:06,370
Don't worry.

340
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:08,836
Your father is in safe hands.

341
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:29,435
Thank you very much.

342
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,512
God has send you to us.

343
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:33,735
We have caused a lot of trouble to you.

344
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:34,872
Don't mention it.

345
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,750
It was not your time yet.

346
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,413
Where were the Crusaders taking you to?

347
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:51,123
I don't know.

348
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:52,961
They did not tell us.

349
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,806
They were probably going to sell us at the captives market I think--

350
00:39:57,872 --> 00:40:01,192
My father.... is a tradesman ,we were captured at the Mediterranean Sea.

351
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,250
Your father must be a good tradesman.

352
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:15,185
Since so many crusaders were taking you.

353
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:16,267
Yes.

354
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:19,186
We were rich.

355
00:40:19,408 --> 00:40:21,318
But we don't have anything anymore.

356
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:25,492
Well....

357
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:28,084
What is this encampent?

358
00:40:29,624 --> 00:40:31,044
You are at the Kayi tribe encampment.

359
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:33,735
I am the son of the Bey (chief) of our encampent: Süleyman Shah.

360
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,226
We owe you three lives.

361
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,852
Do you want to be freed from slavery?

<i>(nodding yes)</i>

363
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,589
Then kill this man.

364
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:52,119
No!

365
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,291
I will buy you and free you.

366
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,420
My commander, you are upset.

367
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,320
Please calm down.

368
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,620
---Shut up!

369
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,220
Don't make me kill you too!

370

I can't do it!

00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:15,656
To be freed...

00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,509

It's ready. Come and have a seat.

Come my son, join us too.

Always be like this my lion.

Don't start new things before finishing your current task.

Where's Gündoğdu?

394
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,310
Eh.. He went to visit the Shepherds. He'll come soon.

395
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:33,407
Add one more plate to the table.

396
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:35,342
It's for Sungur Tekin.

397
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:39,741
If the kid returns one day, he should know he has a place at this table.

Come now.

What is taking Gündoğdu so long?

400
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:47,478
He will be here soon mother.

401
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:48,800
Heh!

Well child, you came back with a great hunt again.

404
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,840
Yes my Bey, that sort of happened.

405
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:24,633
Wonderful of you my brother.

406
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:27,618
You're like a tree attracting lightning in the middel of a plain.

407
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:30,278
You're attracting all kinds of trouble.

408
00:44:36,646 --> 00:44:38,986
The oppressed were being attacked.

409
00:44:39,383 --> 00:44:41,093
We did everything we could do.

410
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,252
Who are they? Whose people are they?

411
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,834
They were captured by the crusaders.

412
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:47,571
Apparently, the man is a tradesman.

413
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,281
My Bey, they are probably from the crusaders' county in Antakya.

414
00:44:50,444 --> 00:44:52,054
Knights, on the Selcuk's lands....

415
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:55,365
....would not randomly carry captives.

416
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:56,243
So?

417
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:57,552
So I mean....

418
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:00,735
The Selcuk's must know about these captives.

419
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,500
There was no Selcuk' Soldier among them.

420
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:08,036
Sooner or later we will figure out what kind of trouble you got in.

421
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:12,562
What should I have done brother? Should I just have let them be?

422
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,050
Shush, both of you.

423
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,320
You have to welcome them in a befitting manner to the Kayi's.

424
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:19,635
Let's see how it will turn out.

425

00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,500
Do I have permission?

428
00:45:50,602 --> 00:45:52,292
Feel welcome, my Bey.

429
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:02,422
How is he doing?

430
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,502
From now on it's God's will.

431
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:11,626
With your permission.

432
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:26,522
Come Aykız.

433
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:34,071
Aykız, Turgut's beloved.

434
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:42,012
I wanted to ask if you needed something.

435
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,556
Thank you.

436
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:46,859
We are already enough of a burden to you.

437
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:48,617
What are you talking about?

438
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:52,494
Bamsı Beyrek and Doğan, are preparing their tents for you.

439
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,410
You will spend your night there.

440
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,420
I......

441
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,670
It's better if I stay beside my father.

442
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:06,574
Rest a bit tonight. You seem distraught.

443
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,290
When your father wakes up tomorrow, he will need you a lot more.

444
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:11,985
Do not worry, I will stay beside your father.

445

Yah! my Bey, Yah!

446
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,520
how did you grow this boil all this time?

447
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:42,938
These boils are no big deal to us Hayme.

448
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:46,358
Should I get afraid of such a small betrayal now?

449
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:50,769
But if you just had crushed this problem from the beginning, then now you would've...

The coyotes were on the mountains in the past, now they came as close as to our homes.

451
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:59,004
They wait for my slightest error to sweep down on me.

452
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:01,903
I hide this boil so they do not see and know my weakness.

453
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:04,199
Rather than becoming their gossip subject....

454
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:07,159
I prefer being silent and broiled in pain.

455
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:10,633
You should have told Akçakoca at least.

456
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:12,795
I did tell him my wife. I did.

457
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,570
He is preparing a healing ointment.

458
00:48:15,688 --> 00:48:18,368
We will apply it this evening if it's fortunate.

Ohh!

What's wrong? Are you thinking about our guests?

461

No.

474

It just felt a bit weird hearing you say that.

Oh my, then why are you giving it to me now?

Because I knew it would look very great on you.

Let me see.

Aykız, isn't it hard to be the wife of an Alp (hero)?

Let him come back to his room unharmed, I do not need anything else.

486
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:43,221
If he just does not die.

487
00:52:45,723 --> 00:52:47,823
Come let's braid your hair too if you want, he?

488
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,989
Yes, let's do it.

489
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:55,025
Do you have a lover?

490
00:52:58,805 --> 00:53:02,805
After my mother died, I had to be a parent for Yiğit....

491
00:53:03,027 --> 00:53:06,617
and a companion for my father, nothing else happened in my life.

492
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:09,699
And besides, what guy would like someone like me.....

493
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:11,099
A aaa! Are you crazy!

494
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:13,895
Guys would kill each other for you.

495
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:16,375
They would bring you all the gold in the world.

496
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:20,775
When was the last time you looked in a mirror?

497
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:22,521
Wait.

498
00:53:54,846 --> 00:53:57,336
Isn't this the brother of the Giaour (infidel) named Titus?

499
00:53:57,518 --> 00:53:59,228
Yes my lord, Bisol.

500
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:01,905
Send these bodies to the templars.

501
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,713
Now we have to deal with Titus too.

502
00:54:05,984 --> 00:54:08,344
You, you, come here.

503
00:54:10,052 --> 00:54:11,752
Take these and load them on the horses.

504
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,190
To which tribe does this weapon belong to?

505
00:54:13,623 --> 00:54:14,723
The Kayi's, my lord.

506
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,430
The Kayi's huh.

507
00:54:20,148 --> 00:54:22,378
It's going to be a problem, if they are in the hands of Süleyman Shah .

508
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:25,663
He's a shepherd chief. You think he will oppose a Selcuk' ?

509
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,488
(<i>sheep and pigeon noises</i>)

510
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,575
Good morning Ertuğrul.

511
00:54:39,551 --> 00:54:40,381
You too.

512
00:54:41,158 --> 00:54:42,698
I brought you food.

513
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:46,626
You did bother, sister Gökçe.

514
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:50,009
How is our wounded doing?

515
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:53,669
Good, he will be able to get up soon inşallah (hopefully with God's will).

516
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,690
Inşallah (hopefully with God's will).

517
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:58,725
May God give curing, so that at least he will not be troublesome to us.

518
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:06,556
(Aykız) I'll come too in a minute, then from there we will go to the household.

519
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:08,074
(Halime) Okay Aykız.

520
00:55:12,552 --> 00:55:16,182
-How is my father doing Ertuğrul Bey (chief)? -Good. Very good.

521
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:19,292
You will see it too when you go inside. His fever reduced.

522
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:22,226
We will move him to your tent this evening inşallah (with Gods will).

523
00:55:34,538 --> 00:55:38,158
Did you see the girl, she already has Ertuğrul in the palm of her hand.

524
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,849
From now on, you will only see him in your dreams.

525
00:55:52,574 --> 00:55:54,654
Did you sleep comfortable?.

526
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:57,911
I haven't slept so comfortable in years.

527
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:09,854
In the forest, you said templars too me.

528
00:56:11,928 --> 00:56:12,498
Yes?

529
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:14,276
Who are they?

530
00:56:22,951 --> 00:56:25,141
A sect fighting to gain Jerusalem.

531
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,625
They are very strong and ruthless.

532
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,642
They want nothing except avenging Jerusalem.

533
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:34,523
If they are so strong, then what do they want from you?

534
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,070
-Is this land of the Selçuks? - Yes.

535
00:56:48,411 --> 00:56:50,901
Do you have an issue with the Selçuks, Halime?

536
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:52,918
Ofcourse not.

537
00:56:54,235 --> 00:56:57,465
What would the Great Selçuks want from people like us?

538
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:18,423
enjoy.

539
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:19,082
Ahh!

540
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:22,656
What happened my girl?

541
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:24,893
It's nothing dad, I just didn't see it.

542
00:57:27,592 --> 00:57:34,082
Haa, even so, mind if you tell me whatever is on your mind anyway he?

543
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:37,385
If you want something really bad, it doesn't happen dad..

544
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:38,963
I learned this.

545
00:57:39,575 --> 00:57:41,075
Who taught you that?

546
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,750
Turgut Alp and I were going to marry if we migrated...

547
00:57:46,815 --> 00:57:48,985
...We have been waiting patiently to migrate.

548
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,030
Winter is coming.

549
00:57:51,692 --> 00:57:54,252
And we still don't know where we are going to migrate to.

550
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:58,801
I understand. You've become as impatient as your late mother was.

551
00:57:59,402 --> 00:58:04,042
Just look around you, winter will never pass in the highlands of these great mountains.

552
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:06,750
Why do you think we gather in the meetings?

553
00:58:07,157 --> 00:58:11,157
Why do you think all the Beys (chiefs) are crowding into Süleyman Shah's tent?

554
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:15,911
We're going to sit, talk and solve this issue inşallah (with God's will).

555
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:20,359
Come now, don't worry. give me my waistcoat, I shouldn't get late.

556
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,889
Oh my sweetest Aykız.

557
00:58:28,497 --> 00:58:30,477
The gathering for the meeting will start soon Kurdoğlu.

558
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:32,282
Nobody knows what they should do.

559
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:33,949
With God's trust we will handle this.

560
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:35,707
Kurdoğlu, the mountains have become quiet...

561
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:38,698
...the rivers wont gurgle, the sky stopped raining.

562
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:40,299
We're cornered in this plain.

563
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:42,543
If this continues, our animals are going to go to waste even more.

564
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:43,610
Babies will die.

565
00:58:45,337 --> 00:58:47,877
Well then, what do you think of?

566
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,243
Whatever suits you best Kurdoğlu.

567
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:53,894
Our commitment is to you. Show your value from now on.

568
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:59,495
Süleyman Shah is weak. He cannot even claim one horse.

569
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,615
You must understand Kurdoğlu...

570
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:05,751
....The one who rides the horse owns it, the one who wields the sword owns it.

571
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:18,792
Mother.

572
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,912
I came to get some healing herbs from Akçakoca.

573
00:59:29,488 --> 00:59:30,748
He went out.

574
00:59:30,937 --> 00:59:32,857
Tell me what you need, I'll go get it for you mother.

575
00:59:32,952 --> 00:59:34,542
No No. I'll get some later.

576
00:59:39,627 --> 00:59:40,647
Our guest.

577
00:59:41,341 --> 00:59:44,961
Numan Bey's daughter, Halime.

578
00:59:48,278 --> 00:59:50,358
Welcome to our encampent my girl.

579
00:59:50,794 --> 00:59:53,104
- How is your father? Good I hope? - Good.

580
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:56,064
Very glad to hear. May God help him heal.

581
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:58,281
You're always welcome to us.

582
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:02,358
If you have worries, do not hesitate to tell us. Okay?

583
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,820
May God bless you, lady Hayme.

584
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:16,173
(<i>Small gathering prayer</i>)

585
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:24,037
Neither on land, nor in the sky, will you find the one carried in the heart of a pure believer...

586
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:28,471
...For he is the Most merciful and most compassionate, the names of God.

587
01:00:30,152 --> 01:00:32,762
Between the blue sky and the dark sky...

588
01:00:33,627 --> 01:00:41,757
there are our descendants!... tribes!... homes!... sons!... daughters!...

589
01:00:42,844 --> 01:00:46,564
Let them be one!... be free!... be alive!...

590
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:51,506
...let this meeting, led under the justifying head-chief, be blessed!

591
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:53,300
Amen!

592
01:00:58,642 --> 01:01:00,532
He who creates in instances...

593
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:06,494
and fill's our hearts with faith, with the Great Allahs 99 names...

594
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:09,376
Ya Bismillah. (In the name of God)

595
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:12,670
(<i>Translators note: Bismillah is being said before starting any action, as prayer for support </i>)

596
01:01:15,953 --> 01:01:17,813
(<i>The chiefs are thanking him</i>)

597
01:01:33,548 --> 01:01:36,198
My chiefs, my brave ones...

598
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:37,861
...the elders of my tribe...

599
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:41,005
I welcome you all, I'm happy to see all of you.

600
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:41,939
(<i>thanking him again</i>)

601
01:01:42,088 --> 01:01:46,528
Thank God, right before we were going to move our wares, a tradesman showed up.

602
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:49,756
I say, let's sell our wares for what they are worth.

603
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:52,605
This way, traveling without wares will be a lot easier for us.

604
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:55,067
If only our only concern were the wares, then it would have been great.

605
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:58,514
There are no grassfields left in our neighbourhood to let our animals graze in.

606
01:01:58,604 --> 01:02:02,604
They don't drink water or give milk anymore. They've gone to waste because of their hunger.

607
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,455
We must find a solution as soon as possible.

608
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:06,958
I know our situation very well too.

609
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:10,847
We contacted all the chiefs in the neighbourhood, asking for a new home.

610
01:02:11,023 --> 01:02:13,443
However, the dryness is everywhere.

611
01:02:14,045 --> 01:02:18,045
And the Türkmen tribes who fled from the Mongolian bandits split up everywhere.

612
01:02:18,141 --> 01:02:21,261
What do you want me to do? Cross swords with our brothers to gain land?

613
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,879
Did God stop giving us his mercy, my bey?

614
01:02:24,343 --> 01:02:26,243
We have been waiting here for months.

615
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:30,308
We're not finding a solution. Since when did the Kayi's become so helpless?

616
01:02:30,774 --> 01:02:32,274
Isn't there a place we can move to?

617
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:35,713
If we cannot find a solution,... How will we keep the tribe standing?

618
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:39,823
Really? Since when did God who always provided us, abandon us?

619
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:49,196
We have always acted with patience..... We only get, whatever comes to us.

620
01:02:49,914 --> 01:02:54,654
I learned what patience is ever since we are traveling without a place to go to. Deli Demir.

621
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:57,945
But the next generations shouldn't live without a home.

622
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,430
Don't you tell me what patience is!

623
01:03:00,492 --> 01:03:03,742
When have I ever left you without clothes?... Left you in hunger?...

624
01:03:03,832 --> 01:03:05,732
...that you have become so desperate for sustenance?

625
01:03:05,914 --> 01:03:08,404
Far from it, my lord! I did not mean it like that.

626
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:11,785
My lord, you have never left us without food nor clothes.

627
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:16,701
However, we too have never left you without soldiers nor defense.

628
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:19,265
My bey, our thoughts are...

629
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:21,941
...Let's find a new place and migrate.

630
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:22,920
Where?

631
01:03:23,038 --> 01:03:25,518
Anywhere the majority of us can survive at.

632
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:30,108
Let's migrate back to our fatherland. They say the Mongolian bandits have weakened.

633
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:31,871
Whoever said that, it's a lie.

634
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:34,902
The mongolian bandits are monsters like hungry wolves.

635
01:03:35,057 --> 01:03:37,047
My bey, don't we have any solution at all?

636
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:41,189
Aleppo. (<i>note: Halep, ancient city in north Syria</i>)

637
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:53,905
I heard that Aleppo's authority, El Aziz....

638
01:03:54,306 --> 01:03:58,016
...is gathering force to oppose the crusaders.

639
01:03:58,327 --> 01:03:59,917
What is it you're thinking of, nephew?

640
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:05,229
I say, let's send El Aziz a messenger.

641
01:04:08,593 --> 01:04:14,213
let him ask for land to let us settle at, and in return we will offer him protection/strength.

642
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:20,260
This way, he will fight the crusaders, where we will become war veterans...

643
01:04:21,154 --> 01:04:24,014
...and will we finally get to gain our own home.

644
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,950
Aleppo.

645
01:04:34,428 --> 01:04:36,818
Let's act immediately my bey.

646
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:39,823
Since when do we act before I said so?

647
01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:43,729
I appologize my bey. (Estağfurullah)

648
01:04:48,696 --> 01:04:51,306
Do we accept Gündoğdu’s idea, chiefs?

649
01:04:51,414 --> 01:04:54,224
(<i>bowing, hand placed on heart</i>) We accept. It's fitting. (<i>note: gesture means you answer with your heart</i>)

650
01:04:54,302 --> 01:04:55,532
I too find it suitable.

651
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:57,692
It will be fortunate with God's will.

652
01:04:57,748 --> 01:05:00,598
(Inşallah) With God's will!

653
01:05:07,256 --> 01:05:09,896
Well, then who will go as our messenger my bey?

654
01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:14,876
(<i>drum sounds</i>)

655
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:25,078
(<i>music - Action</i>)

656
01:05:58,765 --> 01:05:59,835
Ertuğrul.

657
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:12,457
Süleyman Shah, your thoughtless people have broken our honor.

658
01:06:12,921 --> 01:06:16,921
The honor of a sultan who gave us this land, is also my honor Kara Toygar.

659
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:18,872
What have we done to Sultan Alâaddin....

660
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:21,881
...and his commander that we broke their honor?

661
01:06:24,921 --> 01:06:29,261
This axe, was inside the back of the man you killed.

662
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,541
Did you forget your axe there?

663
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:35,799
It seems I did.

664
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:40,015
you ambushed and slaughtered the crusaders who came as messengers.

665
01:06:41,118 --> 01:06:42,678
And as if it was not enough...

666
01:06:42,785 --> 01:06:45,705
...you kidnapped three convicts they were bringing to the sultan.

667
01:06:47,104 --> 01:06:48,674
Give us back those captives.

668
01:06:51,238 --> 01:06:53,918
You talk as if you don't know our tradition Kara Toygar.

669
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:58,849
We will not hand over our tribe's guests. Especially if they are injured.

670
01:06:59,697 --> 01:07:03,147
I came here as the representive of the Sultan of the Selcuk's.

671
01:07:03,495 --> 01:07:07,565
Just as how you have to follow the Sultan's orders, you have to follow my words.

672
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:11,054
You know what will happen on the contrary, Süleyman Shah.

673
01:07:11,385 --> 01:07:14,325
We live with our tradition, we will die with our tradition, Kara Toygar.

674
01:07:14,683 --> 01:07:17,203
We know that the Sultan is a man of a state.

675
01:07:17,424 --> 01:07:21,424
But first comes our ancestor Oğuz's tradition. Thats how you build a throne.

676
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:24,331
A man who knows no tradition, cannot become a Sultan.

677
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:26,023
Neither can he become a Bey (chief)

678
01:07:26,184 --> 01:07:27,084
Nor a man!

679
01:07:28,283 --> 01:07:30,933
And we don't do business with someone who cannot become a man.

680
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:35,110
You should know that as a commander of the gigantic Selcuk empire.

681
01:07:36,547 --> 01:07:38,177
That's the last thing I will say to you.

682
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:39,813
Now go away.

683
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:43,152
We asked you this with our concern Süleyman Shah.

684
01:07:43,823 --> 01:07:45,443
You have 2 days to decide.

685
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:50,511
If you don't hand them over, then I will know how to come and get them.

686
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,110
(<i>throws axe</i>)

687
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:58,829
Do not oppose the Selcuk empire. Or you know what will happen to you.

688
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:11,629
What is my father trying to do?

689
01:08:11,752 --> 01:08:14,742
He doesn't know what he's doing anymore, due to his age.

690
01:08:21,072 --> 01:08:24,002
I told you whatever they were hiding, it wouldn't last long.

691
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,349
You just wait, there's more to come.

692
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:29,352
You stay here.

693
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:47,550
(<i>saying the Islamic creed. note: in this case they are words of martyrdom</i>)

694
01:08:52,478 --> 01:08:56,478
The head-assistant of the Selcuk' Sultan Alâaddin Keykubat.

695
01:09:08,456 --> 01:09:11,156
The commander of the Khwarazmians.

696
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,420
The Caliphates' right hand, Ömer.

697
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:27,879
Now let the whole Islamic world pursue revenge.

698
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:30,534
And then, it will be the pope's turn.

699
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,370
Bisol!!

700
01:10:12,436 --> 01:10:13,796
Who did this?!

701
01:10:14,565 --> 01:10:17,335
They were ambushed when they were bringing the captives.

702
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:19,175
I said who!

703
01:10:20,274 --> 01:10:21,254
The Kayi's.

704
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,947
But we don't know who either.

705
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:29,555
Ertuğrul!

706
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,990
You got us in trouble!

707
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:34,501
Don't push me brother.

708
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:37,219
When are you going to stop being so stubborn, ha?!

709
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:40,517
Nobody cares about them. Neither your father, nor the whole tribe.

710
01:10:40,892 --> 01:10:44,452
If it were you, what would you do? He? What would you do?

711
01:10:44,555 --> 01:10:46,715
Would you just let them go and walk away?

712
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:49,316
The Gündoğdu I know is not a man like that.

713
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:53,230
The Gündoğdu I know, is a man of a state and a man of mercy.

714
01:10:53,627 --> 01:10:54,777
"A state" he says!..

715
01:10:54,982 --> 01:10:56,042
"Mercy" he says!..

716
01:10:56,302 --> 01:10:58,122
What state he?! What mercy?!

717
01:10:58,644 --> 01:11:01,504
Look at our tribe's situation! It's crumbling!

718
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:03,469
There's hunger everywhere.

719
01:11:03,696 --> 01:11:05,696
Winter is coming! And we don't even know where we will migrate to.

720
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,870
The animals have gone to waste because of their hunger.

721
01:11:09,544 --> 01:11:10,564
But "state" he says...

722
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:11,942
"Mercy" he says!..

723
01:11:12,425 --> 01:11:14,735
Now open your eyes... open your eyes!

724
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,026
Take a look around you!

725
01:11:18,873 --> 01:11:20,743
Just right when we were in the middle of the meeting...

726
01:11:21,837 --> 01:11:25,837
...we were discussing vital subjects, and look what you have done!

727
01:11:29,174 --> 01:11:32,404
How is this tribe going to stay on it's feet, Ertuğrul? How?

728
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:51,181
Forgive me, father...

729
01:11:52,282 --> 01:11:53,902
... I couldn't protect him.

730
01:11:57,276 --> 01:11:58,706
I couldn't protect him.

731
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:02,680
I couldn't protect him.

732
01:12:17,608 --> 01:12:20,298
The world is too big to reign over, so why would we be meant to reign over it Aktolgalı.

733
01:12:21,878 --> 01:12:24,218
Why do we have to live in this fake world?

734
01:12:26,529 --> 01:12:28,459
Why do we have to ride horses?

735
01:12:29,113 --> 01:12:30,623
Why do we have to carry swords?

736
01:12:31,586 --> 01:12:33,576
Why do we have to settle a home?

737
01:12:35,591 --> 01:12:39,001
a so called state, tradition, settlement,... why do they exist huh?

738
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:48,435
How cruel, if we don't hand over the guests, he claims he will break us down.

739
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:54,440
Who says we won't break down if we do hand them over?

740
01:13:00,885 --> 01:13:02,505
What should I do Aktolgalı?

741
01:13:08,044 --> 01:13:10,664
For this world, where we cannot even afford to breath...

742
01:13:12,593 --> 01:13:14,183
...should we just lower our heads?

743
01:13:15,383 --> 01:13:17,403
Should we just let the cruelties be?

744
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:20,112
Then won't it be our traditions end?

745
01:13:20,968 --> 01:13:23,098
Then won't our fireplace get extinguished?

746
01:13:23,945 --> 01:13:25,085
Well, Aktolgalı?

747
01:13:38,134 --> 01:13:42,514
Kara Toygar is a cruel man, he wil probably do all kinds of evil things.

748
01:13:43,967 --> 01:13:45,937
You thought well about Aleppo, Gündoğdu.

749
01:13:46,304 --> 01:13:48,154
You like how demonstrated your intelligence to everyone...

750
01:13:48,236 --> 01:13:51,276
...you also demonstrated who will be our next leader, when the time comes.

751
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:58,733
We should first get rid of this troublesome Kara Toygar.

752
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:02,309
When my father mentions the traditions, he will not back down.

753
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:04,587
Oh, Ertuğrul, Oh!

754
01:14:05,544 --> 01:14:07,434
Look what you have got us into.

755
01:14:08,536 --> 01:14:10,456
We need to persuade my father.

756
01:14:10,606 --> 01:14:13,156
If we can convince him, then we will win over Ertuğrul too.

757
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,229
You talk as if you don't know your father.

758
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:18,140
Even if the world crumbles, he won't hand over the captives.

759
01:14:19,693 --> 01:14:21,073
Then what do we do?

760
01:14:23,008 --> 01:14:26,658
Your father told me he is going to send me to Kara Toygar as his messenger.

761
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:29,569
I'll handle the rest.

762
01:14:46,822 --> 01:14:47,762
Ertuğrul Bey.

763
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:51,210
Do you have a moment?

764
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:55,279
What's wrong, did something bad happen?

765
01:14:55,769 --> 01:14:56,359
No.

766
01:14:57,817 --> 01:14:59,567
I wanted to talk about today.

767
01:15:01,036 --> 01:15:01,926
I'm listening.

768
01:15:02,641 --> 01:15:04,261
I heard Kara Toygar came today.

769
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:06,589
He demanded us.

770
01:15:07,117 --> 01:15:07,977
Yes he did.

771
01:15:08,799 --> 01:15:10,979
Don't put your tribe in danger because of us.

772
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,220
We will take care of ourselves.

773
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:17,540
My father is recovering fast. We will leave as soon as possible.

774
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,475
Even if the world would collapse...

775
01:15:22,638 --> 01:15:25,328
...we wouldn't hand you over to those cruel men.

776
01:15:30,102 --> 01:15:33,602
If you engage in a bloody fight with Kara Toygar, this won't end well.

777
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:34,602
Don't worry.

778
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:38,938
We Kayi's are good at confronting all sorts of difficulties.

779
01:16:00,843 --> 01:16:01,913
(Hayme) What's wrong?

780
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:08,348
I can't sleep mother.

781
01:16:09,553 --> 01:16:10,593
Come sit down.

782
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:20,976
What's keeping you awake?

783
01:16:22,232 --> 01:16:25,142
I fell into a burning pit mother, and it's a big one.

784
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,180
I wouldn't mind if it were just me.

785
01:16:28,659 --> 01:16:32,009
I threw this whole tribe into the fire with me.

786
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,110
In the end, did you know this was going to happen?

787
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:43,761
Would you know that you would oppose those infidel bandits....

788
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:48,238
...or about that joke of a commander working together with the crusaders?

789
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:53,316
Well, how about that sweet girl...

790
01:16:54,472 --> 01:16:57,652
...could you have walked away from their screams of help?

791
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,800
How could I ever do that, mother?

792
01:17:04,626 --> 01:17:06,056
You could never do that, ofcourse.

793
01:17:06,858 --> 01:17:08,578
You wouldn't do that, son.

794
01:17:08,818 --> 01:17:09,838
You couldn't.

795
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:15,950
You couldn't neither possibly know what would happen when you went hunting...

796
01:17:18,153 --> 01:17:21,053
...nor that you would throw us all into the fire.

797
01:17:23,202 --> 01:17:24,822
You did throw into the fire.

798
01:17:27,789 --> 01:17:28,699
Yes, you did.

799
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:38,150
some fires turn everything into ash.

800
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,839
and some fires mold their content into something strong.

801
01:17:43,918 --> 01:17:45,978
The fire you fell in is the latter one.

802
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:50,499
Neither you nor the tribe has the right to riot.

803
01:17:51,789 --> 01:17:53,209
This is an exam from God.

804
01:17:55,018 --> 01:17:58,358
This exam can result in turning into ash, or getting stronger.

805
01:17:59,322 --> 01:18:01,792
That's why you need to make sure your delusions...

806
01:18:02,172 --> 01:18:06,172
...and the people in this tribe who don't know their place, are being ignored.

807
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:09,805
Be the soldier of our tribe, son.

808
01:18:11,309 --> 01:18:14,119
Stay beside your fathers orders.

809
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:20,364
May God always let us have you and my father with us.

810
01:18:22,201 --> 01:18:23,991
And may God protect you, son.

811
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,520
Now go take this water and put it next to your father.

812
01:19:58,164 --> 01:19:59,854
I came to bring you water, father.

813
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:05,499
Give it, give it.

814
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:47,915
It should have been me instead of you.

815
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:54,699
I will continue to fight the ones who did this to you, until there's no one left among them.

816
01:20:54,804 --> 01:20:57,594
I will fight until they all lie burried under the earth.

817
01:20:57,778 --> 01:21:00,308
Your death will not be in vain, little brother.

818
01:21:00,882 --> 01:21:01,942
I promise you.

819
01:21:03,384 --> 01:21:05,974
If God will not support my revenge...

820
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:08,137
I'll turn towards the devils.

821
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:12,067
I will carry the Hell towards the Türkmens.

822
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:16,460
Until I die, I will become their wrath.

823
01:21:18,593 --> 01:21:19,713
I promise you.

824
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:27,627
Forgive me father.

825
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:30,955
(<i>Prayer in Latin</i>)

826
01:21:36,883 --> 01:21:39,353
(Süleyman Şah) This is how it is, scholar İlyas.

827
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:42,057
I don't know how to react to this dream.

828
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:46,221
But I've been feeling unwell since yesterday night.

829
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:05,909
There are two possible meanings my bey.

830
01:22:06,274 --> 01:22:08,974
The first one is: there are difficult times awaiting us.

831
01:22:09,408 --> 01:22:14,118
The second: It's a spiritual/moral command of who has to be the messenger.

832
01:22:24,626 --> 01:22:25,376
Dad?

833
01:22:34,535 --> 01:22:36,835
Are you alright? Do you have any pain dad?

834
01:22:36,926 --> 01:22:38,676
Dont worry. I am awake now.

835
01:22:39,312 --> 01:22:40,882
I will recover very quickly.

836
01:22:41,432 --> 01:22:42,642
Thank goodness.

837
01:22:43,885 --> 01:22:44,985
Get well soon.

838
01:22:45,602 --> 01:22:47,812
If you need something, send Yiğit to us.

839
01:22:50,125 --> 01:22:53,185
Ertuğrul, Yiğit told me everything.

840
01:22:54,067 --> 01:22:56,917
You and the ones who raised you are great people.

841
01:22:58,164 --> 01:23:00,124
You embraced us, protected us.

842
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,119
We do whatever our tradition requires us to do. Without debts.

843
01:23:05,303 --> 01:23:09,023
It's been a while since the people on this land forgot their traditions.

844
01:23:09,288 --> 01:23:13,598
God must love us, if he allowed us to meet people like you.

845
01:23:13,794 --> 01:23:15,494
Estağfurullah (Don't mention it).

846
01:23:15,749 --> 01:23:18,019
I should leave. And you should rest.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
