00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.500
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.600
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.330
God would bear a big warrior and
unite the whole world under his flag.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.330
And his progeny would conquer
Constantinople, take Jerusalem...

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.400
...and serve Mecca and Medina.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.860
If God permits, we shall fight under
the flag of that warrior.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.830
If God permits.
I hope you are right, if God permits.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.130
I hope He sends that warrior soon
so that we can find peace, if God permits.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.030
I would like to know these valuable God
followers who shared their food with us.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.500
I am...

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.300
...Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.000
Ertugrul from Kayi Tribe.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.500
I brought you molasses, father.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.300
-Thank you, my girl.
-May it be health.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Well? Tell us now, Gundogdu.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.200
What do you want to do and
require Oguz customs?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.460
If I was a Bey and someone
attacked my tribe...

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.030
...I would think about the punishment
I would give to the soldiers on guard.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.960
What would you have done, Kurdoglu?

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.460
I say, Bey, the punishment given by
Suleyman Shah is well deserved.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.300
Son, one day you may be Bey.
Look for the answer to this question then.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.960
Now, do not busy your mind
on unnecessary business.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.060
Just think about how you can do
your own task the best you can.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.800
-What task is this?
-Starting from tomorrow...

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.530
...you shall be collecting
the goods to be sold in the caravan.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.900
The caravan shall set on
the road in three days.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.400
Bey, why doesn’t the trader
take the goods?

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.190
Karatoygar has bad intensions.
He might raid the caravan.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.460
That is why we can’t give
the goods to the trader.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.200
Gundogdu will do this task with his Alps.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.860
As you wish, father.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.160
You invited me to your table,
shared your food...

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.830
...I shall never forget this kindness.
-May it be health.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.200
I would like permission to leave.
I need to be on my way.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.560
The roads would be dangerous at night.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.500
We can go together at sunrise.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.430
Thank you but I have not seen
my family for months.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.060
I would not want to make
them worry anymore.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.560
I have a carpet shop in the Aleppo market.
I would like to host you there.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.560
If we have time, we may visit.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.360
Please be aware, son.
The crusaders may attack any moment.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.830
-They will not be seen around here today.
-You should still be careful.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.000
They can masquerade and pose as anything.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.260
Thank you.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.960
-How are you, Turgut?
-I am better. Much better.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.060
I regained consciousness.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.260
Where are we?

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.930
When we had the chance,
why didn’t we slain them here?

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.800
We have warriors who killed
15 soldiers of ours.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.230
God accepted my prayers in the end.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.900
He made me meet my enemy.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.300
We will prepare a nice welcome ceremony
for them in Aleppo.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.860
Hear ye, hear ye,
please let it be known...

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.430
...the caravan will set on the road
in two days!

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.060
Orders from Suleyman Shah!

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.460
Dear Akcakoca, do you know what
I thought when this crier shouted caravan?

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.030
If you had listened to what I said,
your caravan would be...

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.230
...from here to China.
-Don’t start again, Wild Demir, don’t.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.360
Look, Akcakoca, you don’t need to
get upset. All I said was that...

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.100
...instead of dealing with these ointments
for wounds, pains, poisons and such...

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.260
...you should have done an ointment for
women, put them in fancy bottles...

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.100
...with bright colors, women would smear
them on their faces and when they...

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.930
...found themselves beautiful,
you would have been bathing in coins.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.560
Go back to your work! Dear God!

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.400
What is happening, my girl? The cows
cannot make dung fast enough for you.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.260
For the love of God, father!
We are all stressed out as it is.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.360
I understand, no one likes to joke around.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.500
Alright?

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.830
Put a bit more.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.960
Is this much dung enough, Halime?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.500
Yes, I hope it is enough.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.930
Everyone is very tense. They say no good
will come out of drapes bathed in dung.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.000
They think all their efforts
will go down in vain.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.230
Look, Aykiz. Why do you think the drapes
they brought to Mother Hayme were faded?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.260
Because the drapes were gray.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.560
First of all, we need to whiten
the drapes we will dye later.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.930
These pieces of dung will make
our drapes as white as snow.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.860
Then you can dye any pattern you like.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.530
Believe me, Aykiz, they will be very nice.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.960
As long as it solves the problem.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.160
But if we mess up, we will be in trouble.
We will be the talk of the tribe.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.000
This one is done, Aykiz.
Dry them in the sun for some time.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.360
May it be easy, Hatuns.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.830
What is happening?
What are you working on?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.130
We bathe the drapes in dung.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.560
You bathe the drapes in dung?
I was not expecting this.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.900
Where did this come from, Aykiz?

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.900
Halime Baci got permission
from Mother Hayme.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.830
What punishment is this? The drapes were
the only place where dirt was not smeared.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.330
What are you doing, Gokce? She invaded the
weavery as well, why didn’t you stop her?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.460
What could I do, sister? Do I have a say
after Mother Hayme accepted?

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.560
Don’t you worry about it. When they mess
up this job, they will pay its price.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.130
Why would an outsider whore pay the price?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.500
If these goods don’t make it
to the caravan in time, we pay the price.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.830
Sister, why are you making
a big deal out of her?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.300
As you overrate this girl,
she starts to get more confident.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.960
Do you know why I am making
a big deal out of her, Gokce?

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.200
Because I have a very naive sister,
that is why.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.500
The man my sister loves,
is tangled in her web.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.100
My sister may not see, but I do.
My sister may not hear, but I do.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.930
The way Ertugrul looks
at this girl is not normal.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.460
Remember my words when
you start crying after him.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.100
I have one rose in three branches

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:52.100
I have sweet made of milk, my dervish

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.830
Help me, Abdul Qadir

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:04.230
I have a problem

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.800
Master.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.500
I can smell your grandfather,
our Master Gilani on you, Halabi.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.060
Thank you. Welcome, master.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.560
We came from a long way with our guests.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.360
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul
from Kayi tribe.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.430
They have a mission,
they will go to the palace.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.130
Then they are in luck, master.
Today is the visiting day of the palace.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.530
If they can see the Emir, today is the day
otherwise they have to wait one month.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.130
The One Who Blesses, son.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:56.160
Dear God, I never thought that I would use
dung to bleach the cloths one day, Halime.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.200
You should see them after they get
snowy white. It will be worth the effort.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.200
Then we will see the faces of those
who talk from our backs.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.300
Well?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.100
We can also bath your dowry drapes
in dung as well.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.330
Of course we can.
As long as they return safe and sound.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.960
-Is your dowry ready?
-Of course it is.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.400
They have been laying inside
the chest for a long time.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.300
Turgut Alp couldn’t get down
from his horse yet.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.800
Why Turgut Alp, why?

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.830
Yes, Aykiz, it is not easy to be
the wife of an Alp.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.000
I have been waiting for
Ertugrul Bey for years.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.360
If it weren’t for the trader’s man
and Wild  Demir...

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.360
...my reputation would have been ruined.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.160
Do you think Karatoygar
will continue with these violations?

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.500
We now know Numan’s worth
in the eye of Karatoygar.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.030
He is more precious than we thought.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.800
Karatoygar would do anything
to get him back.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.330
What will you do?

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.960
Until Ertugrul comes with good news,
we will stay here and be ready for war.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.430
You know the guest’s daughter, Halime?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.930
You should see her. She works endlessly
to make the dye brighter on the drapes.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.500
Do you think she would succeed?
They make the best money in the market.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.160
If God permits, Bey, if God permits.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:46.000
If God permits, we will migrate to Aleppo,
we can think Ertugrul’s wedding and...

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.500
Anyhow, may God let him return from Aleppo
with good news first, then we will see.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.500
Who do you have in mind?

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.330
Gokce.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.800
I am surprised that you find her suitable
while knowing her sister.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.400
Gokce is different. She is a good girl.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:13.000
Maybe this way, she can control
her sister’s endless ambitions.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.830
You would not talk like this
if Gokce did not want to wed.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.460
Well? What about Ertugrul?
Does he have the heart?

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.000
If God permits, we will see about that.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.560
Sister, you made a fool out of me! A fool!

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.860
What are you saying, Gokce?

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.060
Because of you, I faced off with Halime
and told her that I waited for Ertugrul.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.030
What more do you want?
You were too late to act anyway.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.530
Sister, I guess you didn’t understand.
I said everyone heard me. Aykiz as well.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.260
Now everyone will tease me. They will say
that I am dreaming standing up.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.430
-This is your fault.
-Gokce!

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.300
Look at me. Do not care
even if the whole world hears it.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.060
You will win over Ertugrul
just like I did with Gundogdu.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.960
And you will fight with
nails, teeth and all.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.930
With your sweet talk and your beauty,
you will win over that son of a bastard.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.300
You will crush anyone on your path.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.500
Just like I became Gundogdu’s wife,
you will become Ertugrul’s wife.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
We have not settled the score with
Suleyman Shah yet.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.460
Each day the killer of our father sits
in the marquee, is a shame on us...

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.100
...a wound in our heart.
I don’t have any blood left in my veins.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.500
Do you understand? Sitting in the marquee
is our well deserved right and...

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.330
...we will get our right.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.460
What is it you want?

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.100
Did you swallow your tongue, talk!

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.960
A man’s word is said directly
to a man’s face, Bey.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.060
Alright.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.600
My eyes and ears are with you. Talk now.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.230
I came as an ambassador of
Suleyman Shah of Kayi tribe.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.430
I am his son, my name is Ertugrul.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.960
Well?

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.000
What do you want, son of a Bey?

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.130
I came to claim land from you.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.430
You want land?

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.100
What will you give us in exchange?

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.560
Apart from the goats that will damage
our crops and the stench over our city?

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.160
Did the city make you forget
your roots, Bey?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.800
How did you know that
I was Turkmen as well?

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.830
The ring on your thumb. It is obvious
that it is not a mere ornament.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.260
It gives you away, your thumb is damaged
due to shooting arrows to infidels.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.130
If you give us a land, in exchange
2000 Alps will be on your side...

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.930
...anytime you have trouble.
-2000 Alps?

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.830
Even the guards in my palace
is more than this.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.830
May you have a good journey, son of a Bey.
Next.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.260
-Bey.
-Next.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.100
Bey.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.830
Come on.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.000
Come on.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.800
Your guards, count them as three less.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.560
Congratulations.
It was the best spectacle I have watched.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.530
Isn’t that so, Nasir? You clap as well.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.860
Your highness Ameer.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.360
I would like to get to know
this Turkmen warrior better.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.260
We shall listen to the myths, stories
and sagas of the nomads from him...

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.200
...during dinner tonight, what do you say,
my dear uncle?

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.060
I would be honored, your highness.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.100
He sent the bodies of my men.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.360
He thinks he can intimidate me.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.430
Pray that he did not run over
your soldiers.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.800
What are you saying?
Is your Bey opposing the Seljuk state?

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.400
Stop speaking nonsense, Karatoygar.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.930
And don’t try to use Seljuk state
as an excuse.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.930
Sultan Aladdin is not aware
of the things you do here.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.400
I am sure of that.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.230
I understand that these prisoners will
open other doors for you in the state.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.600
You should focus your intelligence
on your own tasks.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.300
What does this intelligence say
about your incompetence, Kurdoglu?

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.600
You should see the incompetence of
your own men first.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.930
They cannot even throw an ambush.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.060
That is enough, Kurdoglu.
If you don’t bring Numan to me...

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.830
...you cannot become the Bey you wish.
I would make the sky fall on you.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.360
You and Suleyman Shah
would be crushed below it.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.860
If you can be patient,
we can both take what we want.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.560
But if you trample over me,
we would both lose.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.130
I am prepared to fight
the whole world for Numan.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.530
Don’t you ever forget this.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.100
Won’t you still tell me
who those prisoners are?

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.360
Don’t think about who they are,
think about who I am.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.830
This is more important for you, Kurdoglu.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.230
What will we do now?

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.560
I will give you Numan and
Suleyman Shah as well.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.100
You will come to collect them
like a ripe date on a branch.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.360
Now, listen to me closely.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.930
When the caravan is ambushed,
Suleyman Shah cannot sit in his tent.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.600
He will come after you.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.230
14 carpets.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.860
Two dozens of wooden spoon.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.130
72 pieces of kerchief.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.460
God bless. God bless.
Your daughter and bride worked very well.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.030
Dear Teyze, you should tie them well so
that we don’t have a problem on the road.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.560
We wrapped them all up, Bey.
We wrapped them very well with my husband.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.500
We don’t have a lot but I beg you...

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.430
...protect the caravan well.
Our livestock died of starvation.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.800
All we have is entrusted in you.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:55.000
I know, Emmi, I know. Don’t you worry.
Trust God first, then us with your goods.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.960
I chose the best Alps I have for this job.
Do not worry about it.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:00.900
Do not worry, people!

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.130
-Alright?
-Yes, Bey. Alright.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.360
Gundogdu...

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.100
...with the money I get from these knives,
I will wed my daughter, let it be known.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.160
You cannot save yourself
from Aykiz’s wrath.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.100
Turgut’s as well.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:22.400
We don’t know the distress they are
in Aleppo, may God be with them.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.960
With you too.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.030
Next.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.330
Don’t come closer.
I would crush you like a millstone.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.230
Please don't do this!

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.230
Anytime water touches my skin,
trouble finds me.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:50.330
-You would go down with me as well.
-Bamsi, there is a feast in the palace.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.260
Decide whether you will eat with us
or in the stable.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.300
Please don’t.
I won’t give you my blessing if you die.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.500
Bamsi, you have no way out.
You have to bathe. Give in.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.230
I will not! I will die but
not submit to this. I will not!

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.260
-You skunk! You asked for this!
-Dear God!

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.430
-Please don’t do this. Dear God!
-Quiet!

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.430
Do not play around.
We will be late to the palace.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.500
You heard our Bey, do not play around.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.560
Bey? Why are you so thoughtful?

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.030
Being invited to
Ameer’s palace is a big thing for us.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.900
They did not give us a land
or a promise, Ilyas.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.360
-We will see what God has planned for us.
-Amen, Bey.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.260
This job shall be finished tonight.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.960
Will the men you send
be able to finish the job?

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.000
You do your part, Nasir.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.960
Which one of you hid my weapons?

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.600
What are you saying?
Didn’t we go inside together?

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.400
-But they are not here, look.
-What do you mean?

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.330
-Mine are not here either.
-They stole mine as well.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.230
I told you! Anytime I bathe,
some trouble happens! You saw it as well!

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.930
We were careless trying to bathe you!

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.260
That’s enough! Shut up!
How will we tell this to our Bey?

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.900
What will you tell me, Turgut?

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.530
-I am asking you, Turgut.
-Bey, they stole our weapons.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.460
What?

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.600
Please, sit.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.500
Please come to the table, Alps.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.860
-Did you lose a man in the fight?
-No, your highness.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:44.260
So, you were ambushed in my territory.
Is that so?

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.530
We will send soldiers and not let them
nest there, right, uncle?

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.360
-Of course, your highness.
-Fine. Alright.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.230
They were punished severe enough.
They are all dead.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:13.130
I know how the famine is affecting
you nomads. Sultan Aladdin is being...

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.360
...over tolerant with you. It is known
how your herds destroy villages and towns.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.830
The struggle between
the Oguz Tribes is another problem.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.530
Everyone is after their herd, after food.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:33.300
Famine hit the tribes hard. But a few
vigilant people cannot be an example.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.430
I am bored. Play something more lively.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.230
Mongols from one side,
crusaders on the other.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.530
I am not even counting
Khwarazmshahs and the Seljuks.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.300
We need an ally to run to this fire with
a bucket of water, not a bellow.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.160
When the factions inside the Muslim world
is demolishing everything...

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.900
...this is what we need.
Is this not so, your highness?

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.100
It is, uncle. We need to put out the fire.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:21.330
Our swords would not go back to their
sheaths, our horses don’t back down.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.860
We also need an ally with a bucket of
water to put out the fire in our home.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.100
How will we make a deal with you, Turkmen?

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.930
We would like a fertile winter quarter
for our tribe.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.860
A quarter.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.230
First you ask a quarter.
Then that would turn into a moorland.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.960
Then you would demand a whole territory.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.430
True, we would.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.900
If I gave you Aleppo...

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.230
...would you be satisfied?

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.900
Instead of offending an Ameer
who opened his land for us...

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.000
...we would let all the herds
we have starve.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.560
-But I have reservations, Ertugrul.
-I am here to clear them up.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.100
We thank you for the presents
Kayi ambassadors brought for us.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.100
If you accept,
we also have some presents for you.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.860
These are our weapons.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.930
Now tell me, Ertugrul. How can we trust
the promises of warriors who cannot...

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.930
...even hold on to their weapons
during peace?

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.260
Why are you there, Nasir?
We are having fun here, come beside me.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:58.000
Now you can go. Go and rest.
You came from a long way.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.360
I will consult with my commanders
tomorrow and give you my decision.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.130
I herewith swear that from now on,
a hand that cannot claim his sword...

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.300
...shall not hold any other weapon.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.330
I wish our weapons had been
struck by lightning...

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.800
...so that our Ertugrul Bey
would not have been humiliated like this.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.330
I wonder what Ertugrul Bey feels
right now. He must be in rage.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.060
Peace be upon you.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:54.000
And peace be upon you,
with God’s Grace and Mercy.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.560
With peace in our world and beyond,
we commemorate one of your followers...

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.560
...who was full of love,
his highness Abdul Qadir Gilani.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.160
Great God...

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.800
...You never make a subject
carry a load too heavy for him.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.430
You put the load of the whole tribe
on my shoulders.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.930
Grant me a way to carry this load.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.600
You took Jonah out from a hole and made
him Sultan of Egypt. Please grant me...

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.500
...an opportunity so that I can climb up
from this bottomless pit I have fallen.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.560
Wake up, my son.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.400
