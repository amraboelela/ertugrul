00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.100
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.530
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.230
Will they die?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.060
Unfortunately it has to be that way.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.360
They will all die, except Gundogdu.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.860
Maybe a lucky Alp will live to bring
the bad news to Suleyman Shah.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.130
I don’t believe it.
The reign of Suleyman Shah will be over.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.060
What a big bad world. Incredible.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.460
What if he insists on customs...

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.900
...and not hand over the prisoners?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.360
What else can he do?
Will he accept the death of his own son?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.000
What will we do if he rounds up
his Alps and attack Karatoygar?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.060
I know Suleyman Shah very well,
he would put his own life at stake.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.530
Karatoygar will kill both of them.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.000
Then only Ertugrul will be left.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.300
-And his death...
-You have gone too far, Bey. Too far.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.830
No good would come out of this.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.230
You dog! If you were so scared,
why did you team up with me?

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.030
For the good of the tribe, Bey.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.500
-I didn’t expect it to be...
-What didn’t you expect? What?

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.830
If a few Alps need to be sacrificed
for the good of the tribe, let them be.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.200
Isn’t it so? Tell me, isn’t it so?

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.030
You are right, Bey.
They can be sacrificed.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.460
May God forgive all their sins.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.300
We did what needed to be done.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.930
If I didn’t convince Karatoygar
to ambush the caravan...

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.460
...he'd have run over us with his army.
Our progeny would have ended.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.600
Now I we need to do is to sit back and
wait for the bad news to reach the tribe.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.560
You go and wash your face,
you need to freshen up.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.230
Watch out for this coward, Alpargu.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.300
If his cowardice lets his tongue loose...

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.560
...don’t be afraid to rip it off.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.130
Everything will be alright, you will see.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.230
Suleyman Shah would not sacrifice his son.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.260
He would not sacrifice him, right?
Of course not.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.300
But he would not step back
from our customs either.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.600
Sister...

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.500
...please do not over think
the situation and devastate yourself.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.100
What if he does something crazy, like
trying to save Gundogdu from Karatoygar?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.300
This is what I am worried about.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.300
I will go and talk with Suleyman Shah.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.600
First he will free Gundogdu.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.560
Then I will take Karatoygar outside
his fort to the place we determined.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.600
When we reach there, the rest will be
up to your courage and skill, son.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.230
-An important matter is being discussed.
-Get out of my way.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.960
-Our Bey’s orders.
-I told you to get out of my way.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.260
We will ambush Karatoygar
at Kartal Tepesi.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.860
Let us talk outside.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.330
I promise that I will deliver my brother
Gundogdu to you safe and sound.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.560
If something happens to Gundogdu...

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.400
...if you sacrifice your brother
for people you collected on the road...

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.230
...you shall never find
peace from me, Ertugrul.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.900
Bey...

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.000
...as a father...

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.030
...I will request one last thing from you.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.060
If you give permission,
I want to entrust my daughter to you.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.930
Karatoygar is after my son and I.
They have no business with my daughter.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.030
My daughter is the tribe’s girl
from now on.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.900
She has no one to turn to
or anywhere to go.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.530
Please be rest assured, Yenge.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.000
Stop! What do you want?

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.060
I wanted to ask about a sergeant.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.330
He used to be a sergeant in my legion.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.530
-What is his name?
-Sari, they call him Sari Bolu.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.830
Of course we know Sari Bolu.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.960
But he is not a sergeant
but a captain now.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.900
Is he in the base?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.860
He went on a mission with Karatoygar.
If you have a message, tell it to us.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.560
I do, warrior, I do.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.460
Welcome, Titus.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.100
Have a seat.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.800
I read the letter Ustad-i Azam
sent with a pigeon.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.500
He does not want Kayis
to migrate to Aleppo.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.900
Yes.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.260
He should not worry.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.030
Kayis will not migrate to Aleppo...

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.960
...but to a place
I find suitable for them.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.600
How?

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.060
Their future Bey thinks just like me.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.100
He prefers to kneel in front of
the Mongols rather than...

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.500
...to be neighbors with the Crusaders.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.100
Who is this man?

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.160
Kurdoglu.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.330
Suleyman Shah’s blood brother.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.530
An ambitious fool.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:44.900
Someone who will do anything we say,
someone we can use as we wish.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.060
What about Suleyman Shah?

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.060
Suleyman Shah...

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.430
...will come to my fort in the evening...

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.800
...and surrender.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.160
Moreover, he will bring with him
the Shahzades...

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.500
...your knights let escape.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.460
Afsin Bey!

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.330
I thought you were dead.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.860
It had to be known like that, Bolu.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.100
Our state is under a big threat.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.330
I need your help.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.330
Why is this ominous news late?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.230
Bey, Suleyman Shah calls you to his tent.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.400
Whatever happens,
Karatoygar should not get the Shahzades.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.930
What if he succeeds in taking
the Shahzades to Sultan Aladdin?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.260
He would be Aladdin’s favorite commander.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.100
Templars would have Konya in their hands.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.500
They would roam within the palace.
The consequences would be deadly, Sari.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.600
This state was founded
with great difficulty.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.830
We will not refrain from killing
the Shahzades if needed.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.930
I am ready to do anything
you want from me, Bey.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.360
Thank you, I know that, Sari, I know.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.100
What a tyrant this Karatoygar is!

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.030
How could he dare to kill our warriors?
As if that is not enough...

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.930
...he captured Gundogdu as a prisoner?
-Yes.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.930
Now, they expect me to deliver our guests.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.830
That means that the death of
this rabid dog will be from us.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.560
Let us go with our Alps and
make the sky fall on them.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.330
No!

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.960
I will go alone.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.430
I won’t let you go alone.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.530
Did we become blood brothers for one to
stay behind and cry like women...

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:29.030
...while the other one
is going for a certain death, Bey?

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.430
The path I will be on
is full of unknowns, Kurdoglu.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.860
How can I go on this road if
my blood brother is not staying behind...

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.100
...to protect and serve my tribe
in case something happens to me?

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.800
You shall be taking
my place until I return.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.830
Put this on as well.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.930
Do not feel cold on the road.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.330
-Sister...
-Say it, my lion.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.860
What if I can’t see you again?

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.060
What are you saying, Yigit?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.500
We survived so many difficulties together.
We passed so many obstacles.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.430
We will pass this one as well.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.800
But this time we are separated.
You will not be with us.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.600
-What if those men take us and...
-Do not worry your pure heart like this.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.030
Look, this time we are not alone.
There are Beys of the tribe.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.830
They will protect us, they care for us.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.460
Always stay beside my father.
Do everything he says, alright?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.100
And do not think about me.
I will sit here and wait for you.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.830
There will be no sadness, do we agree?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.160
Come on.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.830
Now go...

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.960
...and say goodbye to your friends. Go on.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.460
Father.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.900
I am just talking so that
Yigit is not scared or gets sad but...

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.060
...my mind does not believe my own words.
How will it end?

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.860
My girl, it has been a very long time.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.130
We went through many sorrows
by running away and getting captured.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.800
This thing will finish once and for all,
if God permits.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.060
Ertugrul has a plan.
I found it probable as well.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:11.030
With God’s permission,
we shall go and come back in one piece.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.600
This tribe paid a very big price for us.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.200
We can never repay them for all they did.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.430
Please let me.
Let me come with you as well.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.260
Whatever happens, good or bad...

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.300
...we should be together at the end.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.300
You pray for us, that is enough, my girl.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.330
My precious and brave daughter with
a beautiful heart and a beautiful face.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.430
Just like her mother, self sacrificing
and loyal. My beautiful daughter.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.260
Do not worry.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.060
Everything will be fine.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.530
What happened? What do you want?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.200
Come with us.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.860
This boil is hurting
like a knife in my back.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.860
My Bey...

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.100
...your pain is my pain.
But there is nothing I can do.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.230
All I can do is to pray
for you and my sons.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.260
We went through so many sorrows,
so many journeys, so many battles.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:12.360
We had the privilege to grow old.
Thank God, we have seen these days, Hayme.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.100
You are right, Bey.
We saw so many weddings, so many babies...

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.130
...so many springs.
We saw so many victories.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.830
If God permits, we will continue
to see more.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.930
I want your blessing.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.160
These problems are not permanent
and our lives are not eternal, Bey.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.960
You always walked on the righteous path.
You never bowed to tyrants.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.960
Has anyone seen a person
on the righteous path getting lost?

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.560
If God permits,
I will see you and my sons’ return.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.160
May God be with you.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.000
My blessing is with you.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.400
Thank you.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.030
What is it? What do you want?

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.560
Where do you go,
where do you come from, Afsin Bey?

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.060
I want to hear what you are made of
from your mouth.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.800
Dear God, please protect them, Dear God.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.860
You called for me, mother.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.830
I did. Come and sit down.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.200
Yes, mother?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.360
Ertugrul Bey?

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.260
Do we have permission?

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.860
Halime Sultan comes to our tent,
does she need a permission?

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.430
Ertugrul Bey...

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.030
...I lied to you.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.060
Yes, you did.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.960
Do you understand now, why we had to go?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.830
Why the days we spent in this tribe are
only a dream that we would wake from?

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.560
You are happy here.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.100
Despite a life you lived in a palace...

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.460
...you talk about a nomad life
like a dream, Halime.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.800
Even if the whole world comes together...

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.130
...I will not let you become unhappy.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.830
Do you understand me, my girl?

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.930
I did, mother.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.600
Good.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.600
You may go now.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.160
Instead of reacting and
spewing out bitter words...

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:55.200
...recite God’s name, pray
and fill your heart with goodness...

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.100
...so that our fate be good as well.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.300
The problem is not my happiness.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.400
The problem is my father’s
and my brother’s life.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.100
Do not worry.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.130
I will not let anything happen
to your father or your brother.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.360
I will bring them back to you
safe and sound.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.060
You can be rest assured.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.060
After all the things that have been
robbed and taken away from me...

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.100
...you are taking with you
all that is left.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.360
My father, my brother.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.600
I beg you to return with them.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.160
Return and complete
the thing that is missing inside me.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.560
If I do not return, know that...

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.160
...whatever I had missing inside me,
I found it in you.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.900
Their intention is not good, Gokce...

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.360
...they will let my man die
in the name of customs.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.530
Sister, Suleyman Shah
is a human being as well.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.960
Would a human let his child be slain?
Get rid of these delusions from your mind.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.100
You do not know who Suleyman Shah is.
He would even burn his tribe for customs.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.600
I have to find a way, Gokce, I have to.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.900
I will not let them sacrifice my man!

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.530
Dear God!

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.200
Ertugrul’s Alps have prepared
their horses and weapons, waiting to go.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.100
I have things to say to you, Kurdoglu.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.130
What happened, Selcan Hatun?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.200
Gundogdu trusts you, he respects you.
You know that.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.800
What about you, Selcan Hatun?

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.160
-I have always trusted your bravery.
-Thank you.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.230
What happened to Gundogdu is not
acceptable. But do not worry...

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.400
...Suleyman Shah will bring him back.
-No he will not.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.230
If you are brave, if you do not want
Suleyman Shah to throw...

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.130
...his tribe into fire,
if you respect Gundogdu a little bit...

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.830
If Suleyman Shah
does something like this...

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.600
...I would throw him into the fire myself.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.900
Now I am listening to you, Selcan Hatun.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.560
Suleyman Shah and Ertugrul...

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.530
...will ambush
Karatoygar at Kartal Tepesi.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.500
-What are you saying, Selcan Hatun?
-I heard it with my own ears.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.230
Suleyman Shah decided to be loyal
to his customs rather than his son!

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.930
Do not tell this to anyone, Selcan Hatun.
And you did not talk with me...

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.860
...we did not see each other.
Alright, Selcan Hatun?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.900
What will happen to Gundogdu?

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.330
We will find a solution.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.830
Go on, get out before anyone sees you.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.030
Will we let them go, Bey?

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:47.030
We will, so that Karatoygar’s hunt
can be more fruitful, Alpargu.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.130
I cleaned the tribe from all filth
without drawing a sword...

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.360
...or getting blood on my hands.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.860
Come on, get on your horse.
You have things to say to Karatoygar.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.930
I swear on the horses
that run endlessly...

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.060
I swear on the horseshoes that sparkle...

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:21.860
If I am scared to die for our tribe,
for our Bey, for our customs...

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:26.830
...may I be slain by my own steel sword,
like a crop in the field.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.400
May the blue sky tear,
may the brave ground sink...

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.130
...may my name be erased
from all monuments.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:42.860
May my forefather Oguz,
my blessed tribe sue me in the next life!

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:48.060
In this path I have taken,
may God be by my side...

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.330
...may Godsend Hıdr accompany me.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.160
Come on, Titus. Relax a bit.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.500
Today is our day.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.500
We will both get what we want.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.960
You were this comfortable
when Ertugrul was going to Aleppo as well.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.330
You were this relaxed.
Then we know what happened.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.130
Your soldiers’ incompetence.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.330
Sir, Suleyman Shah.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.560
Let us not make our visitors wait.
Let them in.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.600
He came alone, sir.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.900
Bring him here immediately.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:28.000
Let us see whether you will eat what you
hope or what you find, Karatoygar.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:03.330
You, what are you up to, Suleyman Shah?
Where are they?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.060
You will get what you want
after you release my son.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.900
Do you want to be killed?

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:16.900
Is my son’s and my life more valuable
or the Shahzades?

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.030
You will free Gundogdu, Karatoygar!

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:26.830
Are you threatening me?

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.230
If something happens to Gundogdu...

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.430
...Ertugrul will take them outside
Seljuk territory.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.500
You will never find them again.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.160
Not you, not the Templars you work for.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.560
If you free my son...

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.230
...I will take them to you.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.160
Where are they?

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.460
Ertugrul is guarding them
so they don’t run away.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.600
If something happens to us...

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.000
...Sultan Aladdin will be
informed of everything.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.000
Shahzade wrote a letter
about everything he faced in detail.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.230
How he was a captive
in Templars hands for months...

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.300
...all the tortures he went through
for refusing to claim being the Sultan.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.800
How he never betrayed his state
despite the torture.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.500
How you cooperated with the Templars.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.200
In short, everything.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.530
The decision is yours.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.160
Father?

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.260
My son.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.330
What happened?

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.830
-Did you give the prisoners to Karatoygar?
-No.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.130
-Father?
-Karatoygar freed you.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.030
Go to the tribe.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.230
-Father, that man would not let you live.
-Do as I tell you, Gundogdu.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.800
Go now.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.930
Father.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.160
-Be quick.
-Go on.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.860
I said go!

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.400
What happened, Akcakoca?
Is there someone inside?

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.930
What is happening here?
What is this outrage?

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.030
Get out of the way, Akcakoca.
We want to see who is inside.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.600
-What is it to you?
-I said get out of the way!

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.300
The things we heard are true!

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.060
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.200
What do you think you are doing?

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.230
Our sons have died, Mother Hayme.
All because of them!

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.030
They ambushed the caravan
but you hide it from us!

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.200
So you violate our customs and our Bey.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.030
-Shame on you all!
-That is enough, Mother Hayme.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.900
You are saying customs but how many more
lives shall be sacrificed?

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.860
Where are the bodies of our sons?

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:34.430
-Where is Suleyman Shah?
-My son has died, not yours, Mother Hayme.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:41.100
Everyone in this tribe is my child,
my heart!

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.330
A tribe can only stand strong
when they are united.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.000
If there is no unity, you would be
condemned to lose against the enemy...

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:58.900
...and be wiped out! Has Suleyman Shah Bey
ever put his own live before yours?

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.400
Has he ever put his own sons before yours,
has he ever chose a path other than...

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.230
...the goodness of the tribe?

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.430
Whatever he does, he does for the welfare,
for the future of the tribe.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:17.430
Breaking the unity of the tribe while
he is gone, to cry out mutiny...

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.430
...is this what you see befitting
for yourselves?

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.330
If you try to crush the customs...

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.960
...you will be crushed one day.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.960
From now on, anyone stoning them...

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.060
...would be stoning me!

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.460
Anyone who faces them, would be facing me!

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.560
Let this be known!

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.460
Come, my girl!

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.830
KARATOYGAR INN

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.560
They are playing with you.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.160
How did they learn our relationship,
Titus?

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.100
Ertugrul.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.230
It was a matter of time for him
to connect the dots.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.230
God damn! I need to kill them all.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:39.560
What will happen to the letter
Shahzade wrote to the Sultan?

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:47.130
My friends in the palace will make sure
that letter is not seen by the Sultan.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.900
I hope so.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:13.830
They will see who the game
and who the hunter is.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:18.400
God forbid, I was scared that
something may happen to you.

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.800
If something happened to you,
what could I have said to Suleyman Shah?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.060
Stay here until they return.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.430
We can be companions while
waiting for our loved ones to return.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.930
With prayer, with belief, with patience.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.600
This tribe has survived through
so many hardships.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.530
All the pain is still here...

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.130
...in my heart.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:08.560
God knows that I have never felt
so desperate in my life.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.800
My two sons...

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.500
...my man...

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.230
I lived through so many hardships
in this short life of mine.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.300
People who want to kill
my father and brother...

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.330
...the states who wanted to use them
because they were Shahzades...

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.960
...the nights we rotted in dungeons.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.830
I lived with the anxiety of losing
my loved ones every day I breathed.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.430
Ertugrul Bey woke us up
from that nightmare...

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.860
...he put us in a beautiful dream.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.860
Mother Hayme...

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.930
...I found the peace I yearned
for my whole life in your tribe.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.930
Your wish is accepted.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.960
Now it is my turn, Suleyman Shah.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560
